title: Exponential savings in agnostic active learning through abstention
abstract: We show that in pool-based active classification without assumptions on
  the underlying distribution, if the learner is given the power to abstain from some
  predictions by paying the price marginally smaller than the average loss 1/2 of
  a random guess, exponential savings in the number of label requests are possible
  whenever they are possible in the corresponding realizable problem. We extend this
  result to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential savings in
  pool-based active classification under the model misspecification.
