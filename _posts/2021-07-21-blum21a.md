title: Robust learning under clean-label attack
abstract: "We study the problem of robust learning under\r clean-label data-poisoning
  attacks, where the\r attacker injects (an arbitrary set of)\r \\emph{correctly-labeled}
  examples to the training\r set to fool the algorithm into making mistakes on\r \\emph{specific}
  test instances at test time. The\r learning goal is to minimize the attackable rate\r
  (the probability mass of attackable test instances),\r which is more difficult than
  optimal PAC\r learning. As we show, any robust algorithm with\r diminishing attackable
  rate can achieve the optimal\r dependence on $\\epsilon$ in its PAC sample\r complexity,
  i.e., $O(1/\\epsilon)$. On the other\r hand, the attackable rate might be large
  even for\r some optimal PAC learners, e.g., SVM for linear\r classifiers. Furthermore,
  we show that the class of\r linear hypotheses is not robustly learnable when the\r
  data distribution has zero margin and is robustly\r learnable in the case of positive
  margin but\r requires sample complexity exponential in the\r dimension. For a general
  hypothesis class with\r bounded VC dimension, if the attacker is limited to\r add
  at most $t=O(1/\\epsilon)$ poison examples, the\r optimal robust learning sample
  complexity grows\r linearly with $t$."
