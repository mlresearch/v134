title: "Bounded Memory Active Learning through Enriched\r Queries"
abstract: "The explosive growth of easily-accessible unlabeled\r data has lead to
  growing interest in \\emph{active\r learning}, a paradigm in which data-hungry learning\r
  algorithms adaptively select informative examples in\r order to lower prohibitively
  expensive labeling\r costs. Unfortunately, in standard worst-case models\r of learning,
  the active setting often provides no\r improvement over non-adaptive algorithms.
  To combat\r this, a series of recent works have considered a\r model in which the
  learner may ask \\emph{enriched}\r queries beyond labels. While such models have
  seen\r success in drastically lowering label costs, they\r tend to come at the expense
  of requiring large\r amounts of memory. In this work, we study what\r families of
  classifiers can be learned in\r \\emph{bounded memory}. To this end, we introduce
  a\r novel streaming-variant of enriched-query active\r learning along with a natural
  combinatorial\r parameter called \\emph{lossless sample compression}\r that is sufficient
  for learning not only with\r bounded memory, but in a query-optimal and\r computationally
  efficient manner as well. Finally,\r we give three fundamental examples of classifier\r
  families with small, easy to compute lossless\r compression schemes when given access
  to basic\r enriched queries: axis-aligned rectangles, decision\r trees, and halfspaces
  in two dimensions."
