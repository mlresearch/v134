title: "Optimal Dynamic Regret in Exp-Concave Online\r Learning"
abstract: "We consider the problem of the Zinkevich\r (2003)-style dynamic regret
  minimization in online\r learning with \\emph{exp-concave} losses. We show\r that
  whenever improper learning is allowed, a\r Strongly Adaptive online learner achieves
  the\r dynamic regret of $\\tilde O^*(n^{1/3}C_n^{2/3} \\vee\r 1)$ where $C_n$ is
  the \\emph{total variation}\r (a.k.a. \\emph{path length}) of the an arbitrary\r
  sequence of comparators that may not be known to the\r learner ahead of time. Achieving
  this rate was\r highly nontrivial even for square losses in 1D where\r the best
  known upper bound was $O(\\sqrt{nC_n} \\vee\r \\log n)$ (Yuan and Lamperski, 2019).
  Our new proof\r techniques make elegant use of the intricate\r structures of the
  primal and dual variables imposed\r by the KKT conditions and could be of independent\r
  interest. Finally, we apply our results to the\r classical statistical problem of
  \\emph{locally\r adaptive non-parametric regression} (Mammen, 1991;\r Donoho and
  Johnstone, 1998) and obtain a stronger\r and more flexible algorithm that do not
  require any\r statistical assumptions or any hyperparameter\r tuning."
