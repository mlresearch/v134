title: Spectral Planting and the Hardness of Refuting Cuts, Colorability, and Communities
  in Random Graphs
abstract: 'We study the problem of efficiently refuting the k-colorability of a graph,
  or equivalently, certifying a lower bound on its chromatic number. We give formal
  evidence of average-case computational hardness for this problem in sparse random
  regular graphs, suggesting that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that improves
  upon a classical spectral algorithm. Our evidence takes the form of a "computationally-quiet
  planting": we construct a distribution of d-regular graphs that has significantly
  smaller chromatic number than a typical regular graph drawn uniformly at random,
  while providing evidence that these two distributions are indistinguishable by a
  large class of algorithms. We generalize our results to the more general problem
  of certifying an upper bound on the maximum k-cut.  This quiet planting is achieved
  by minimizing the effect of the planted structure (e.g. colorings or cuts) on the
  graph spectrum. Specifically, the planted structure corresponds exactly to eigenvectors
  of the adjacency matrix. This avoids the pushout effect of random matrix theory,
  and delays the point at which the planting becomes visible in the spectrum or local
  statistics. To illustrate this further, we give similar results for a Gaussian analogue
  of this problem: a quiet version of the spiked model, where we plant an eigenspace
  rather than adding a generic low-rank perturbation.  Our evidence for computational
  hardness of distinguishing two distributions is based on three different heuristics:
  stability of belief propagation, the local statistics hierarchy, and the low-degree
  likelihood ratio. Of independent interest, our results include general-purpose bounds
  on the low-degree likelihood ratio for multi-spiked matrix models, and an improved
  low-degree analysis of the stochastic block model.'
