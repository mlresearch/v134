title: "Spectral Planting and the Hardness of Refuting Cuts,\r Colorability, and Communities
  in Random Graphs"
abstract: "We study the problem of efficiently refuting the\r k-colorability of a
  graph, or equivalently,\r certifying a lower bound on its chromatic number. We\r
  give formal evidence of average-case computational\r hardness for this problem in
  sparse random regular\r graphs, suggesting that there is no polynomial-time\r algorithm
  that improves upon a classical spectral\r algorithm. Our evidence takes the form
  of a\r \"computationally-quiet planting\": we construct a\r distribution of d-regular
  graphs that has\r significantly smaller chromatic number than a\r typical regular
  graph drawn uniformly at random,\r while providing evidence that these two\r distributions
  are indistinguishable by a large class\r of algorithms. We generalize our results
  to the more\r general problem of certifying an upper bound on the\r maximum k-cut.
  \ This quiet planting is achieved by\r minimizing the effect of the planted structure\r
  (e.g. colorings or cuts) on the graph\r spectrum. Specifically, the planted structure\r
  corresponds exactly to eigenvectors of the adjacency\r matrix. This avoids the pushout
  effect of random\r matrix theory, and delays the point at which the\r planting becomes
  visible in the spectrum or local\r statistics. To illustrate this further, we give\r
  similar results for a Gaussian analogue of this\r problem: a quiet version of the
  spiked model, where\r we plant an eigenspace rather than adding a generic\r low-rank
  perturbation.  Our evidence for\r computational hardness of distinguishing two\r
  distributions is based on three different\r heuristics: stability of belief propagation,
  the\r local statistics hierarchy, and the low-degree\r likelihood ratio. Of independent
  interest, our\r results include general-purpose bounds on the\r low-degree likelihood
  ratio for multi-spiked matrix\r models, and an improved low-degree analysis of the\r
  stochastic block model."
