title: "Source Identification for Mixtures of Product\r Distributions"
abstract: "We give an algorithm for source identification of a\r mixture of k product
  distributions on n bits. This\r is a fundamental problem in machine learning with\r
  many applications. Our algorithm identifies the\r source parameters of an identifiable
  mixture, given,\r as input, approximate values of multilinear moments\r (derived,
  for instance, from a sufficiently large\r sample), using $2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(k)}$ arithmetic\r
  operations. Our result is the first explicit bound\r on the computational complexity
  of source\r identification of such mixtures. The running time\r improves previous
  results by Feldman, Oâ€™Donnell, and\r Servedio (FOCS 2005) and Chen and Moitra (STOC
  2019)\r that guaranteed only learning the mixture (without\r parametric identification
  of the source). Our\r analysis gives a quantitative version of a\r qualitative characterization
  of identifiable sources\r that is due to Tahmasebi, Motahari, and Maddah-Ali\r (ISIT
  2018)."
