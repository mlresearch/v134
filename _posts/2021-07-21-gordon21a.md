title: Source Identification for Mixtures of Product Distributions
abstract: We give an algorithm for source identification of a mixture of k product
  distributions on n bits. This is a fundamental problem in machine learning with
  many applications. Our algorithm identifies the source parameters of an identifiable
  mixture, given, as input, approximate values of multilinear moments (derived, for
  instance, from a sufficiently large sample), using $2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(k)}$ arithmetic
  operations. Our result is the first explicit bound on the computational complexity
  of source identification of such mixtures. The running time improves previous results
  by Feldman, Oâ€™Donnell, and Servedio (FOCS 2005) and Chen and Moitra (STOC 2019)
  that guaranteed only learning the mixture (without parametric identification of
  the source). Our analysis gives a quantitative version of a qualitative characterization
  of identifiable sources that is due to Tahmasebi, Motahari, and Maddah-Ali (ISIT
  2018).
