title: Sequential prediction under log-loss and misspecification
abstract: 'We consider the question of sequential prediction under the log-loss in
  terms of cumulative regret. Namely, given a hypothesis class of distributions, learner
  sequentially predicts the (distribution of the) next letter in sequence and its
  performance is compared to the baseline of the best constant predictor from the
  hypothesis class. The well-specified case corresponds to an additional assumption
  that the data-generating distribution belongs to the hypothesis class as well. Here
  we present results in the more general misspecified case. Due to special properties
  of the log-loss, the same problem arises in the context of competitive-optimality
  in density estimation, and model selection.  For the $d$-dimensional Gaussian location
  hypothesis class, we show that cumulative regrets in the well-specified and misspecified
  cases asymptotically coincide. In other words, we provide an $o(1)$ characterization
  of the distribution-free (or PAC) regret in this case – the first such result as
  far as we know. We recall that the worst-case (or individual-sequence) regret in
  this case is larger by an additive constant ${d\over 2} + o(1)$.  Surprisingly,
  neither the traditional Bayesian estimators, nor the Shtarkov’s normalized maximum
  likelihood achieve the PAC regret and our estimator requires special “robustification”
  against heavy-tailed data.  In addition, we show two general results for misspecified
  regret: the existence and uniqueness of the optimal estimator, and the bound sandwiching
  the misspecified regret between well-specified regrets with (asymptotically) close
  hypotheses classes.'
