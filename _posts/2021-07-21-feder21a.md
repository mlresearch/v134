title: "Sequential prediction under log-loss and\r misspecification"
abstract: "We consider the question of sequential prediction\r under the log-loss
  in terms of cumulative\r regret. Namely, given a hypothesis class of\r distributions,
  learner sequentially predicts the\r (distribution of the) next letter in sequence
  and\r its performance is compared to the baseline of the\r best constant predictor
  from the hypothesis\r class. The well-specified case corresponds to an\r additional
  assumption that the data-generating\r distribution belongs to the hypothesis class
  as\r well. Here we present results in the more general\r misspecified case. Due
  to special properties of the\r log-loss, the same problem arises in the context
  of\r competitive-optimality in density estimation, and\r model selection.  For the
  $d$-dimensional Gaussian\r location hypothesis class, we show that cumulative\r
  regrets in the well-specified and misspecified cases\r asymptotically coincide.
  In other words, we provide\r an $o(1)$ characterization of the distribution-free\r
  (or PAC) regret in this case – the first such\r result as far as we know. We recall
  that the\r worst-case (or individual-sequence) regret in this\r case is larger by
  an additive constant ${d\\over 2} +\r o(1)$.  Surprisingly, neither the traditional\r
  Bayesian estimators, nor the Shtarkov’s normalized\r maximum likelihood achieve
  the PAC regret and our\r estimator requires special “robustification”\r against
  heavy-tailed data.  In addition, we show two\r general results for misspecified
  regret: the\r existence and uniqueness of the optimal estimator,\r and the bound
  sandwiching the misspecified regret\r between well-specified regrets with (asymptotically)\r
  close hypotheses classes."
