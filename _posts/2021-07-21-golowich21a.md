title: "Differentially Private Nonparametric Regression\r Under a Growth Condition"
abstract: "Given a real-valued hypothesis class H, we\r investigate under what conditions
  there is a\r differentially private algorithm which learns an\r optimal hypothesis
  from H given\r i.i.d. data. Inspired by recent results for the\r related setting
  of binary classification (Alon et\r al., 2019; Bun et al., 2020), where it was shown\r
  that online learnability of a binary class is\r necessary and sufficient for its
  private\r learnability, Jung et al. (2020) showed that in the\r setting of regression,
  online learnability of H is\r necessary for private learnability. Here online\r
  learnability of H is characterized by the finiteness\r of its eta-sequential fat
  shattering dimension,\r sfat_eta(H), for all eta > 0. In terms of sufficient\r conditions
  for private learnability, Jung et\r al. (2020) showed that H is privately learnable
  if\r lim_{\\eta -> 0} sfat_eta(H) is finite, which is a\r fairly restrictive condition.
  We show that under the\r relaxed condition liminf_{eta -> 0} eta *\r sfat_eta(H)
  = 0, H is privately learnable, thus\r establishing the first nonparametric private\r
  learnability guarantee for classes H with\r sfat_eta(H) diverging as eta -> 0. Our
  techniques\r involve a novel filtering procedure to output stable\r hypotheses for
  nonparametric function classes."
