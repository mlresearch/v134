title: "A Priori Generalization Analysis of the Deep Ritz\r Method for Solving High
  Dimensional Elliptic Partial\r Differential Equations"
abstract: "This paper concerns the a priori generalization\r analysis of the Deep
  Ritz Method (DRM) [W. E and\r B. Yu, 2017], a popular neural-network-based method\r
  for solving high dimensional partial differential\r equations.  We derive the generalization
  error\r bounds of two-layer neural networks in the framework\r of the DRM for solving
  two prototype elliptic PDEs:\r Poisson equation and static Schr√∂dinger equation\r
  on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube. Specifically,\r we prove that the convergence
  rates of\r generalization errors are independent of the\r dimension $d$, under the
  a priori assumption that\r the exact solutions of the PDEs lie in a suitable\r low-complexity
  space called spectral Barron\r space. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on\r
  the forcing term and the potential function which\r guarantee that the solutions
  are spectral Barron\r functions. We achieve this by developing a new\r solution
  theory for the PDEs on the spectral Barron\r space, which can be viewed as an analog
  of the\r classical Sobolev regularity theory for PDEs."
