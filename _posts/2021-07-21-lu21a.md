title: A Priori Generalization Analysis of the Deep Ritz Method for Solving High Dimensional
  Elliptic Partial Differential Equations
abstract: 'This paper concerns the a priori generalization analysis of the Deep Ritz
  Method (DRM) [W. E and B. Yu, 2017], a popular neural-network-based method for solving
  high dimensional partial differential equations.  We derive the generalization error
  bounds of two-layer neural networks in the framework of the DRM for solving two
  prototype elliptic PDEs: Poisson equation and static Schr√∂dinger equation on the
  $d$-dimensional unit hypercube. Specifically, we prove that the convergence rates
  of generalization errors are independent of the dimension $d$, under the a priori
  assumption that the exact solutions of the PDEs lie in a suitable low-complexity
  space called spectral Barron space. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on the
  forcing term and the potential function which guarantee that the solutions are spectral
  Barron functions. We achieve this by developing a new solution theory for the PDEs
  on the spectral Barron space, which can be viewed as an analog of the classical
  Sobolev regularity theory for PDEs.'
