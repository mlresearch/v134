title: Corruption-robust exploration in episodic reinforcement learning
abstract: We initiate the study of episodic reinforcement learning under adversarial
  corruptions in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of the underlying
  system extending recent results for the special case of multi-armed bandits. We
  provide a framework which modifies the aggressive exploration enjoyed by existing
  reinforcement learning approaches based on “optimism in the face of uncertainty”,
  by complementing them with principles from “action elimination”. Importantly, our
  framework circumvents the major challenges posed by naively applying action elimination
  in the RL setting, as formalized by a lower bound we demonstrate. Our framework
  yields efficient algorithms which (a) attain near-optimal regret in the absence
  of corruptions and (b) adapt to unknown levels corruption, enjoying regret guarantees
  which degrade gracefully in the total corruption encountered. To showcase the generality
  of our approach, we derive results for both tabular settings (where states and actions
  are finite) as well as linear MDP settings (where the dynamics and rewards admit
  a linear underlying representation). Notably, our work provides the first sublinear
  regret guarantee which accommodates any deviation from purely i.i.d. transitions
  in the bandit feedback model for episodic reinforcement learning.
