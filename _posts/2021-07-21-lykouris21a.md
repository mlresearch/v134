title: "Corruption-robust exploration in episodic\r reinforcement learning"
abstract: "We initiate the study of episodic reinforcement\r learning under adversarial
  corruptions in both the\r rewards and the transition probabilities of the\r underlying
  system extending recent results for the\r special case of multi-armed bandits. We
  provide a\r framework which modifies the aggressive exploration\r enjoyed by existing
  reinforcement learning\r approaches based on “optimism in the face of\r uncertainty”,
  by complementing them with principles\r from “action elimination”. Importantly,
  our\r framework circumvents the major challenges posed by\r naively applying action
  elimination in the RL\r setting, as formalized by a lower bound we\r demonstrate.
  Our framework yields efficient\r algorithms which (a) attain near-optimal regret
  in\r the absence of corruptions and (b) adapt to unknown\r levels corruption, enjoying
  regret guarantees which\r degrade gracefully in the total corruption\r encountered.
  To showcase the generality of our\r approach, we derive results for both tabular\r
  settings (where states and actions are finite) as\r well as linear MDP settings
  (where the dynamics and\r rewards admit a linear underlying\r representation). Notably,
  our work provides the\r first sublinear regret guarantee which accommodates\r any
  deviation from purely i.i.d. transitions in the\r bandit feedback model for episodic
  reinforcement\r learning."
