title: "Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling of Numerically\r Sparse Matrices"
abstract: "Many real-world data sets are sparse or almost\r sparse. One method to
  measure this for a matrix\r $A\\in \\R^{n\\times n}$ is the \\emph{numerical\r sparsity},
  denoted $\\mathsf{ns}(A)$, defined as the\r minimum $k\\geq 1$ such that $\\|a\\|_1/\\|a\\|_2
  \\leq\r \\sqrt{k}$ for every row and every column $a$ of\r $A$. This measure of
  $a$ is smooth and is clearly\r only smaller than the number of non-zeros in the\r
  row/column $a$.  The seminal work of Achlioptas and\r McSherry (2007) has put forward
  the question of\r approximating an input matrix $A$ by entrywise\r sampling. More
  precisely, the goal is to quickly\r compute a sparse matrix $\\tilde{A}$ satisfying
  $\\|A\r - \\tilde{A}\\|_2 \\leq \\epsilon \\|A\\|_2$ (i.e.,\r additive spectral
  approximation) given an error\r parameter $\\epsilon>0$. The known schemes sample
  and\r rescale a small fraction of entries from $A$.  We\r propose a scheme that
  sparsifies an almost-sparse\r matrix $A$ â€” it produces a matrix $\\tilde{A}$ with\r
  $O(\\epsilon^{-2}\\mathsf{ns}(A) \\cdot n\\ln n)$\r non-zero entries with high probability.
  We also\r prove that this upper bound on\r $\\mathsf{nnz}(\\tilde{A})$ is \\emph{tight}
  up to\r logarithmic factors. Moreover, our upper bound\r improves when the spectrum
  of $A$ decays quickly\r (roughly replacing $n$ with the stable rank of\r $A$). Our
  scheme can be implemented in time\r $O(\\mathsf{nnz}(A))$ when $\\|A\\|_2$ is\r
  given. Previously, a similar upper bound was\r obtained by Achlioptas et al. (2013),
  but only for a\r restricted class of inputs that does not even\r include symmetric
  or covariance matrices. Finally,\r we demonstrate two applications of these sampling\r
  techniques, to faster approximate matrix\r multiplication, and to ridge regression
  by using\r sparse preconditioners."
