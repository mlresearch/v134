title: Outlier-Robust Learning of Ising Models Under Dobrushin’s Condition
abstract: We study the problem of learning Ising models satisfying Dobrushin’s condition
  in the outlier-robust setting where a constant fraction of the samples are adversarially
  corrupted. Our main result is to provide the first computationally efficient robust
  learning algorithm for this problem with near-optimal error guarantees. Our algorithm
  can be seen as a special case of an algorithm for robustly learning a distribution
  from a general exponential family. To prove its correctness for Ising models, we
  establish new anti-concentration results for degree-2 polynomials of Ising models
  that may be of independent interest.
