title: "Outlier-Robust Learning of Ising Models Under\r Dobrushin’s Condition"
abstract: "We study the problem of learning Ising models\r satisfying Dobrushin’s
  condition in the\r outlier-robust setting where a constant fraction of\r the samples
  are adversarially corrupted. Our main\r result is to provide the first computationally\r
  efficient robust learning algorithm for this problem\r with near-optimal error guarantees.
  Our algorithm\r can be seen as a special case of an algorithm for\r robustly learning
  a distribution from a general\r exponential family. To prove its correctness for\r
  Ising models, we establish new anti-concentration\r results for degree-2 polynomials
  of Ising models\r that may be of independent interest."
