title: "Survival of the strictest: Stable and unstable\r equilibria under regularized
  learning with partial\r information"
abstract: "In this paper, we examine the Nash equilibrium\r convergence properties
  of no-regret learning in\r general N -player games. For concreteness, we focus\r
  on the archetypal “follow the regularized leader”\r (FTRL) family of algorithms,
  and we consider the\r full spectrum of uncertainty that the players may\r encounter
  – from noisy, oracle-based feedback, to\r bandit, payoff-based information. In this
  general\r context, we establish a comprehensive equivalence\r between the stability
  of a Nash equilibrium and its\r support: a Nash equilibrium is stable and attracting\r
  with arbitrarily high probability if and only if it\r is strict (i.e., each equilibrium
  strategy has a\r unique best response). This equivalence extends\r existing continuous-time
  versions of the “folk\r theorem” of evolutionary game theory to a bona fide\r algorithmic
  learning setting, and it provides a\r clear refinement criterion for the prediction
  of the\r day-to-day behavior of no-regret learning in games."
