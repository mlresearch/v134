title: 'Survival of the strictest: Stable and unstable equilibria under regularized
  learning with partial information'
abstract: 'In this paper, we examine the Nash equilibrium convergence properties of
  no-regret learning in general N -player games. For concreteness, we focus on the
  archetypal “follow the regularized leader” (FTRL) family of algorithms, and we consider
  the full spectrum of uncertainty that the players may encounter – from noisy, oracle-based
  feedback, to bandit, payoff-based information. In this general context, we establish
  a comprehensive equivalence between the stability of a Nash equilibrium and its
  support: a Nash equilibrium is stable and attracting with arbitrarily high probability
  if and only if it is strict (i.e., each equilibrium strategy has a unique best response).
  This equivalence extends existing continuous-time versions of the “folk theorem”
  of evolutionary game theory to a bona fide algorithmic learning setting, and it
  provides a clear refinement criterion for the prediction of the day-to-day behavior
  of no-regret learning in games.'
