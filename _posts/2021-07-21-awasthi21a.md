title: "Adversarially Robust Low Dimensional\r Representations"
abstract: "Many machine learning systems are vulnerable to\r small perturbations made
  to inputs either at test\r time or at training time. This has received much\r recent
  interest on the empirical front due to\r applications where reliability and security
  are\r critical. However, theoretical understanding of\r algorithms that are robust
  to adversarial\r perturbations is limited.  In this work we focus on\r Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous\r algorithmic primitive in machine learning.
  \ We\r formulate a natural robust variant of PCA where the\r goal is to find a low
  dimensional subspace to\r represent the given data with minimum projection\r error,
  that is in addition robust to small\r perturbations measured in $\\ell_q$ norm (say\r
  $q=\\infty$). Unlike PCA which is solvable in\r polynomial time, our formulation
  is computationally\r intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of\r the well-studied
  sparse PCA objective as a special\r case. We show the following results: 1. Polynomial\r
  time algorithm that is constant factor competitive\r in the worst-case with respect
  to the best subspace,\r in terms of the projection error and the robustness\r criterion.
  \ 2. We show that our algorithmic\r techniques can also be made robust to adversarial\r
  training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding\r representations that are
  robust to adversarial\r perturbations at test time. Specifically, we design\r algorithms
  for a strong notion of training-time\r perturbations, where every point is adversarially\r
  perturbed up to a specified amount.  3. We\r illustrate the broad applicability
  of our\r algorithmic techniques in addressing robustness to\r adversarial perturbations,
  both at training time and\r test time. In particular, our adversarially robust\r
  PCA primitive leads to computationally efficient and\r robust algorithms for both
  unsupervised and\r supervised learning problems such as clustering and\r learning
  adversarially robust classifiers."
