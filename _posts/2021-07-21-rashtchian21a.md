title: Average-Case Communication Complexity of Statistical Problems
abstract: We study statistical problems, such as planted clique, its variants, and
  sparse principal component analysis in the context of average-case communication
  complexity. Our motivation is to understand the statistical-computational trade-offs
  in streaming, sketching, and query-based models. Communication complexity is the
  main tool for proving lower bounds in these models, yet many prior results do not
  hold in an average-case setting. We provide a general reduction method that preserves
  the input distribution for problems involving a random graph or matrix with planted
  structure. Then, we derive two-party and multi-party communication lower bounds
  for detecting or finding planted cliques, bipartite cliques, and related problems.
  As a consequence, we obtain new bounds on the query complexity in the edge-probe,
  vector-matrix-vector, matrix-vector, linear sketching, and $\mathbb{F}_2$-sketching
  models. Many of these results are nearly tight, and we use our techniques to provide
  simple proofs of some known lower bounds for the edge-probe model.
