title: "Average-Case Communication Complexity of Statistical\r Problems"
abstract: "We study statistical problems, such as planted\r clique, its variants,
  and sparse principal component\r analysis in the context of average-case\r communication
  complexity. Our motivation is to\r understand the statistical-computational trade-offs\r
  in streaming, sketching, and query-based\r models. Communication complexity is the
  main tool\r for proving lower bounds in these models, yet many\r prior results do
  not hold in an average-case\r setting. We provide a general reduction method that\r
  preserves the input distribution for problems\r involving a random graph or matrix
  with planted\r structure. Then, we derive two-party and multi-party\r communication
  lower bounds for detecting or finding\r planted cliques, bipartite cliques, and
  related\r problems. As a consequence, we obtain new bounds on\r the query complexity
  in the edge-probe,\r vector-matrix-vector, matrix-vector, linear\r sketching, and
  $\\mathbb{F}_2$-sketching models. Many\r of these results are nearly tight, and
  we use our\r techniques to provide simple proofs of some known\r lower bounds for
  the edge-probe model."
