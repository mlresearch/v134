title: "Robust Online Convex Optimization in the Presence of\r Outliers"
abstract: "We consider online convex optimization when a number\r k of data points
  are outliers that may be\r corrupted. We model this by introducing the notion\r
  of robust regret, which measures the regret only on\r rounds that are not outliers.
  The aim for the\r learner is to achieve small robust regret, without\r knowing where
  the outliers are. If the outliers are\r chosen adversarially, we show that a simple\r
  filtering strategy on extreme gradients incurs O(k)\r overhead compared to the usual
  regret bounds, and\r that this is unimprovable, which means that k needs\r to be
  sublinear in the number of rounds. We further\r ask which additional assumptions
  would allow for a\r linear number of outliers. It turns out that the\r usual benign
  cases of independently, identically\r distributed (i.i.d.) observations or strongly
  convex\r losses are not sufficient. However, combining\r i.i.d. observations with
  the assumption that\r outliers are those observations that are in an\r extreme quantile
  of the distribution, does lead to\r sublinear robust regret, even though the expected\r
  number of outliers is linear."
