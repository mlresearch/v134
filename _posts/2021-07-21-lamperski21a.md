title: "Projected Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithms\r for Constrained Sampling
  and Non-Convex Learning"
abstract: "Langevin algorithms are gradient descent methods\r with additive noise.
  They have been used for decades\r in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling,\r
  optimization, and learning. Their convergence\r properties for unconstrained non-convex
  optimization\r and learning problems have been studied widely in\r the last few
  years. Other work has examined\r projected Langevin algorithms for sampling from\r
  log-concave distributions restricted to convex\r compact sets. For learning and
  optimization,\r log-concave distributions correspond to convex\r losses. In this
  paper, we analyze the case of\r non-convex losses with compact convex constraint\r
  sets and IID external data variables. We term the\r resulting method the projected
  stochastic gradient\r Langevin algorithm (PSGLA). We show the algorithm\r achieves
  a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4} (log T )^{1/2}\r )$ from its target distribution in 1-Wasserstein\r
  distance. For optimization and learning, we show\r that the algorithm achieves $\\epsilon$-suboptimal\r
  solutions, on average, provided that it is run for a\r time that is polynomial in
  $\\epsilon$ and slightly\r super-exponential in the problem dimension."
