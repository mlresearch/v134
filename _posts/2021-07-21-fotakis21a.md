title: Efficient Algorithms for Learning from Coarse Labels
abstract: 'For many learning problems one may not have access to fine grained label
  information; e.g., an image can be labeled as husky, dog, or even animal depending
  on the expertise of the annotator.  In this work, we formalize these settings and
  study the problem of learning from such coarse data.  Instead of observing the actual
  labels from a set $\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition
  of $\mathcal{Z}$ (or a mixture of partitions).  Our main algorithmic result is that
  essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently
  when the coarse data are sufficiently informative.  We obtain our result through
  a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels
  given only coarse labels.  The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially
  on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels $|\mathcal{Z}|$.  We
  also investigate the case of (infinitely many) real valued labels focusing on a
  central problem in censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean estimation from
  coarse data.  We provide an efficient algorithm when the sets in the partition are
  convex and establish that the problem is NP-hard even for very simple non-convex
  sets.'
