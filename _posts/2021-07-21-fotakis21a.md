title: "Efficient Algorithms for Learning from Coarse\r Labels"
abstract: "For many learning problems one may not have access\r to fine grained label
  information; e.g., an image\r can be labeled as husky, dog, or even animal\r depending
  on the expertise of the annotator.  In\r this work, we formalize these settings
  and study the\r problem of learning from such coarse data.  Instead\r of observing
  the actual labels from a set\r $\\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels\r corresponding
  to a partition of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or a\r mixture of partitions).  Our main algorithmic
  result\r is that essentially any problem learnable from fine\r grained labels can
  also be learned efficiently when\r the coarse data are sufficiently informative.
  \ We\r obtain our result through a generic reduction for\r answering Statistical
  Queries (SQ) over fine grained\r labels given only coarse labels.  The number of\r
  coarse labels required depends polynomially on the\r information distortion due
  to coarsening and the\r number of fine labels $|\\mathcal{Z}|$.  We also\r investigate
  the case of (infinitely many) real\r valued labels focusing on a central problem
  in\r censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean\r estimation from coarse data.
  \ We provide an\r efficient algorithm when the sets in the partition\r are convex
  and establish that the problem is NP-hard\r even for very simple non-convex sets."
