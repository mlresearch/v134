title: 'Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning without Prior Knowledge: an Optimal
  Black-box Approach'
abstract: We propose a black-box reduction that turns a certain reinforcement learning
  algorithm with optimal regret in a (near-)stationary environment into another algorithm
  with optimal dynamic regret in a non-stationary environment, importantly without
  any prior knowledge on the degree of non-stationarity.  By plugging different algorithms
  into our black-box, we provide a list of examples showing that our approach not
  only recovers recent results for (contextual) multi-armed bandits achieved by very
  specialized algorithms, but also significantly improves the state of the art for
  (generalzed) linear bandits, episodic MDPs, and infinite-horizon MDPs in various
  ways. Specifically, in most cases our algorithm achieves the optimal dynamic regret
  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min\{\sqrt{LT}, \Delta^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}}\})$
  where $T$ is the number of rounds and $L$ and $\Delta$ are the number and amount
  of changes of the world respectively, while previous works only obtain suboptimal
  bounds and/or require the knowledge of $L$ and $\Delta$.
