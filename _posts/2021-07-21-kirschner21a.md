title: Asymptotically Optimal Information-Directed Sampling
abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient algorithm for stochastic linear bandits
  with finitely many actions that is asymptotically optimal and (nearly) worst-case
  optimal in finite time. The approach is based on the frequentist information-directed
  sampling (IDS) framework, with a surrogate for the information gain that is informed
  by the optimization problem that defines the asymptotic lower bound. Our analysis
  sheds light on how IDS balances the trade-off between regret and information and
  uncovers a surprising connection between the recently proposed primal-dual methods
  and the IDS algorithm. We demonstrate empirically that IDS is competitive with UCB
  in finite-time, and can be significantly better in the asymptotic regime.
