title: "Asymptotically Optimal Information-Directed\r Sampling"
abstract: "We introduce a simple and efficient algorithm for\r stochastic linear bandits
  with finitely many actions\r that is asymptotically optimal and (nearly)\r worst-case
  optimal in finite time. The approach is\r based on the frequentist information-directed\r
  sampling (IDS) framework, with a surrogate for the\r information gain that is informed
  by the\r optimization problem that defines the asymptotic\r lower bound. Our analysis
  sheds light on how IDS\r balances the trade-off between regret and\r information
  and uncovers a surprising connection\r between the recently proposed primal-dual
  methods\r and the IDS algorithm. We demonstrate empirically\r that IDS is competitive
  with UCB in finite-time, and\r can be significantly better in the asymptotic\r regime."
