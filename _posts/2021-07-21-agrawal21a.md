title: Regret Minimization in Heavy-Tailed Bandits
abstract: "We revisit the classic regret-minimization problem\r in the stochastic
  multi-armed bandit setting when\r the arm-distributions are allowed to be\r heavy-tailed.
  Regret minimization has been well\r studied in simpler settings of either bounded\r
  support reward distributions or distributions that\r belong to a single parameter
  exponential family. We\r work under the much weaker assumption that the\r moments
  of order \\((1+\\epsilon)\\){are} uniformly\r bounded by a known constant \\(B\\),
  for some given \\(\r \\epsilon > 0\\). We propose an optimal algorithm that\r matches
  the lower bound exactly in the first-order\r term. We alsoÂ give a finite-time bound
  on its\r regret. We show that our index concentrates faster\r than the well-known
  truncated or trimmed empirical\r mean estimators for the mean of heavy-tailed\r
  distributions. Computing our index can be\r computationally demanding. To address
  this, we\r develop a batch-based algorithm that is optimal up\r to a multiplicative
  constant depending on the batch\r size. We hence provide a controlled trade-off\r
  between statistical optimality and computational\r cost."
