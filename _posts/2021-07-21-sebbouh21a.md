title: "Almost sure convergence rates for Stochastic\r Gradient Descent and Stochastic
  Heavy Ball"
abstract: "We study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the\r stochastic heavy ball
  method (SHB, otherwise known\r as the momentum method) for the general stochastic\r
  approximation problem.  For SGD, in the convex and\r smooth setting, we provide
  the first \\emph{almost\r sure} asymptotic convergence \\emph{rates} for a\r weighted
  average of the iterates . More precisely,\r we show that the convergence rate of
  the function\r values is arbitrarily close to $o(1/\\sqrt{k})$, and\r is exactly
  $o(1/k)$ in the so-called\r overparametrized case. We show that these results\r
  still hold when using a decreasing step size version\r of stochastic line search
  and stochastic Polyak\r stepsizes, thereby giving the first proof of\r convergence
  of these methods in the\r non-overparametrized regime.  Using a substantially\r
  different analysis, we show that these rates hold\r for SHB as well, but at the
  last iterate. This\r distinction is important because it is the last\r iterate of
  SGD and SHB which is used in practice. We\r also show that the last iterate of SHB
  converges to\r a minimizer \\emph{almost surely}. Additionally, we\r prove that
  the function values of the deterministic\r HB converge at a $o(1/k)$ rate, which
  is faster than\r the previously known $O(1/k)$.  Finally, in the\r nonconvex setting,
  we prove similar rates on the\r lowest gradient norm along the trajectory of SGD."
