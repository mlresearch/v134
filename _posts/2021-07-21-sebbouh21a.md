title: Almost sure convergence rates for Stochastic Gradient Descent and Stochastic
  Heavy Ball
abstract: We study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the stochastic heavy ball
  method (SHB, otherwise known as the momentum method) for the general stochastic
  approximation problem.  For SGD, in the convex and smooth setting, we provide the
  first \emph{almost sure} asymptotic convergence \emph{rates} for a weighted average
  of the iterates . More precisely, we show that the convergence rate of the function
  values is arbitrarily close to $o(1/\sqrt{k})$, and is exactly $o(1/k)$ in the so-called
  overparametrized case. We show that these results still hold when using a decreasing
  step size version of stochastic line search and stochastic Polyak stepsizes, thereby
  giving the first proof of convergence of these methods in the non-overparametrized
  regime.  Using a substantially different analysis, we show that these rates hold
  for SHB as well, but at the last iterate. This distinction is important because
  it is the last iterate of SGD and SHB which is used in practice. We also show that
  the last iterate of SHB converges to a minimizer \emph{almost surely}. Additionally,
  we prove that the function values of the deterministic HB converge at a $o(1/k)$
  rate, which is faster than the previously known $O(1/k)$.  Finally, in the nonconvex
  setting, we prove similar rates on the lowest gradient norm along the trajectory
  of SGD.
