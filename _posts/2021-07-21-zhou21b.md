title: "A Local Convergence Theory for Mildly\r Over-Parameterized Two-Layer Neural
  Network"
abstract: "While over-parameterization is widely believed to be\r crucial for the
  success of optimization for the\r neural networks, most existing theories on\r over-parameterization
  do not fully explain the\r reason—they either work in the Neural Tangent\r Kernel
  regime where neurons don’t move much, or\r require an enormous number of neurons.
  In practice,\r when the data is generated using a teacher neural\r network, even
  mildly over-parameterized neural\r networks can achieve 0 loss and recover the\r
  directions of teacher neurons. In this paper we\r develop a local convergence theory
  for mildly\r over-parameterized two-layer neural net. We show\r that as long as
  the loss is already lower than a\r threshold (polynomial in relevant parameters),
  all\r student neurons in an over-parameterized two-layer\r neural network will converge
  to one of teacher\r neurons, and the loss will go to 0. Our result holds\r for any
  number of student neurons as long as it is\r at least as large as the number of
  teacher neurons,\r and our convergence rate is independent of the\r number of student
  neurons. A key component of our\r analysis is the new characterization of local\r
  optimization landscape—we show the gradient\r satisfies a special case of Lojasiewicz
  property\r which is different from local strong convexity or PL\r conditions used
  in previous work."
