title: Boosting in the Presence of Massart Noise
abstract: We study the problem of boosting the accuracy of a weak learner in the (distribution-independent)
  PAC model with Massart noise. In the Massart noise model, the label of each example
  $x$ is independently misclassified with probability $\eta(x) \leq \eta$, where $\eta<1/2$.
  The Massart model lies between the random classification noise model and the agnostic
  model. Our main positive result is the first computationally efficient boosting
  algorithm in the presence of Massart noise that achieves misclassification error
  arbitrarily close to $\eta$. Prior to our work, no non-trivial booster was known
  in this setting. Moreover, we show that this error upper bound is best possible
  for polynomial-time black-box boosters, under standard cryptographic assumptions.
  Our upper and lower bounds characterize the complexity of boosting in the distribution-independent
  PAC model with Massart noise. As a simple application of our positive result, we
  give the first efficient Massart learner for unions of high-dimensional rectangles.
