title: Boosting in the Presence of Massart Noise
abstract: "We study the problem of boosting the accuracy of a\r weak learner in the
  (distribution-independent) PAC\r model with Massart noise. In the Massart noise\r
  model, the label of each example $x$ is\r independently misclassified with probability\r
  $\\eta(x) \\leq \\eta$, where $\\eta<1/2$. The Massart\r model lies between the
  random classification noise\r model and the agnostic model. Our main positive\r
  result is the first computationally efficient\r boosting algorithm in the presence
  of Massart noise\r that achieves misclassification error arbitrarily\r close to
  $\\eta$. Prior to our work, no non-trivial\r booster was known in this setting.
  Moreover, we show\r that this error upper bound is best possible for\r polynomial-time
  black-box boosters, under standard\r cryptographic assumptions. Our upper and lower\r
  bounds characterize the complexity of boosting in\r the distribution-independent
  PAC model with Massart\r noise. As a simple application of our positive\r result,
  we give the first efficient Massart learner\r for unions of high-dimensional rectangles."
