title: Learning in Matrix Games can be Arbitrarily Complex
abstract: Many multi-agent systems with strategic interactions have their desired
  functionality encoded as the Nash equilibrium of a game, e.g. machine learning architectures
  such as Generative Adversarial Networks. Directly computing a Nash equilibrium of
  these games is often impractical or impossible in practice, which has led to the
  development of numerous learning algorithms with the goal of iteratively converging
  on a Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, the dynamics generated by the learning process
  can be very intricate and instances failing to converge become hard to interpret.
  In this paper we show that, in a strong sense, this dynamic complexity is inherent
  to games. Specifically, we prove that replicator dynamics, the continuous-time analogue
  of Multiplicative Weights Update, even when applied in a very restricted class of
  games–known as finite matrix games–is rich enough to be able to approximate arbitrary
  dynamical systems. In the context of machine learning, our results are positive
  in the sense that they show the nearly boundless dynamic modelling capabilities
  of current machine learning practices, but also negative in implying that these
  capabilities may come at the cost of interpretability. As a concrete example, we
  show how replicator dynamics can effectively reproduce the well-known strange attractor
  of Lonrenz dynamics (the “butterfly effect") while achieving no regret.
