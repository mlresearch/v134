title: Learning in Matrix Games can be Arbitrarily Complex
abstract: "Many multi-agent systems with strategic interactions\r have their desired
  functionality encoded as the Nash\r equilibrium of a game, e.g. machine learning\r
  architectures such as Generative Adversarial\r Networks. Directly computing a Nash
  equilibrium of\r these games is often impractical or impossible in\r practice, which
  has led to the development of\r numerous learning algorithms with the goal of\r
  iteratively converging on a Nash\r equilibrium. Unfortunately, the dynamics generated\r
  by the learning process can be very intricate and\r instances failing to converge
  become hard to\r interpret. In this paper we show that, in a strong\r sense, this
  dynamic complexity is inherent to\r games. Specifically, we prove that replicator\r
  dynamics, the continuous-time analogue of\r Multiplicative Weights Update, even
  when applied in\r a very restricted class of games–known as finite\r matrix games–is
  rich enough to be able to\r approximate arbitrary dynamical systems. In the\r context
  of machine learning, our results are\r positive in the sense that they show the
  nearly\r boundless dynamic modelling capabilities of current\r machine learning
  practices, but also negative in\r implying that these capabilities may come at the\r
  cost of interpretability. As a concrete example, we\r show how replicator dynamics
  can effectively\r reproduce the well-known strange attractor of\r Lonrenz dynamics
  (the “butterfly effect\") while\r achieving no regret."
