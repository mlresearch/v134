title: "Adversarially Robust Learning with Unknown\r Perturbation Sets"
abstract: "We study the problem of learning predictors that are\r robust to adversarial
  examples with respect to an\r unknown perturbation set, relying instead on\r interaction
  with an adversarial attacker or access\r to attack oracles, examining different
  models for\r such interactions. We obtain upper bounds on the\r sample complexity
  and upper and lower bounds on the\r number of required interactions, or number of\r
  successful attacks, in different interaction models,\r in terms of the VC and Littlestone
  dimensions of the\r hypothesis class of predictors, and without any\r assumptions
  on the perturbation set."
