title: "Learning to Sample from Censored Markov Random\r Fields"
abstract: "We study the problem of learning Censored Markov\r Random Fields (abbreviated
  CMRFs), which are Markov\r Random Fields where some of the nodes are censored\r
  (i.e. not observed). We assume the CMRF is high\r temperature but, crucially, make
  no assumption about\r its structure. This makes structure learning\r impossible.
  Nevertheless we introduce a new\r definition, which we call learning to sample,
  that\r circumvents this obstacle. We give an algorithm that\r can learn to sample
  from a distribution within\r $\\epsilon n$ earthmover distance of the target\r distribution
  for any $\\epsilon > 0$. We obtain\r stronger results when we additionally assume
  high\r girth, as well as computational lower bounds showing\r that these are essentially
  optimal."
