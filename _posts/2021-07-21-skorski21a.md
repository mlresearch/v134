title: "Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transforms with Best\r Confidence"
abstract: "The seminal result of Johnson and Lindenstrauss on\r random embeddings
  has been intensively studied in\r applied and theoretical computer science. Despite\r
  that vast body of literature, we still lack of\r complete understanding of statistical
  properties of\r random projections; a particularly intriguing\r question is: why
  are the theoretical bounds that far\r behind the empirically observed performance?\r
  Motivated by this question, this work develops\r Johnson-Lindenstrauss distributions
  with optimal,\r data-oblivious, statistical confidence bounds. These\r bounds are
  numerically best possible, for any given\r data dimension, embedding dimension,
  and distortion\r tolerance. They improve upon prior works in terms of\r statistical
  accuracy, as well as exactly determine\r the no-go regimes for data-oblivious\r
  approaches. Furthermore, the projection matrices are\r efficiently samplable.  The
  construction relies on\r orthogonal matrices, and the proof uses certain\r elegant
  properties of the unit sphere. In\r particular, the following techniques introduced
  in\r this work are of independent interest: a) a compact\r expression for the projection
  distortion in terms of\r singular eigenvalues of the projection matrix, b) a\r parametrization
  linking the unit sphere and the\r Dirichlet distribution and c) anti-concentration\r
  bounds for the Dirichlet distribution.  Besides the\r technical contribution, the
  paper presents\r applications and numerical evaluation along with\r working implementation
  in Python (shared as a GitHub\r repository)."
