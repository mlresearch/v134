title: Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transforms with Best Confidence
abstract: 'The seminal result of Johnson and Lindenstrauss on random embeddings has
  been intensively studied in applied and theoretical computer science. Despite that
  vast body of literature, we still lack of complete understanding of statistical
  properties of random projections; a particularly intriguing question is: why are
  the theoretical bounds that far behind the empirically observed performance? Motivated
  by this question, this work develops Johnson-Lindenstrauss distributions with optimal,
  data-oblivious, statistical confidence bounds. These bounds are numerically best
  possible, for any given data dimension, embedding dimension, and distortion tolerance.
  They improve upon prior works in terms of statistical accuracy, as well as exactly
  determine the no-go regimes for data-oblivious approaches. Furthermore, the projection
  matrices are efficiently samplable.  The construction relies on orthogonal matrices,
  and the proof uses certain elegant properties of the unit sphere. In particular,
  the following techniques introduced in this work are of independent interest: a)
  a compact expression for the projection distortion in terms of singular eigenvalues
  of the projection matrix, b) a parametrization linking the unit sphere and the Dirichlet
  distribution and c) anti-concentration bounds for the Dirichlet distribution.  Besides
  the technical contribution, the paper presents applications and numerical evaluation
  along with working implementation in Python (shared as a GitHub repository).'
