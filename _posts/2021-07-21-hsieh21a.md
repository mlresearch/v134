title: "Adaptive Learning in Continuous Games: Optimal\r Regret Bounds and Convergence
  to Nash Equilibrium"
abstract: "In game-theoretic learning, several agents are\r simultaneously following
  their individual interests,\r so the environment is non-stationary from each\r playerâ€™s
  perspective. In this context, the\r performance of a learning algorithm is often\r
  measured by its regret. However, no-regret\r algorithms are not created equal in
  terms of\r game-theoretic guarantees: depending on how they are\r tuned, some of
  them may drive the system to an\r equilibrium, while others could produce cyclic,\r
  chaotic, or otherwise divergent trajectories. To\r account for this, we propose
  a range of no-regret\r policies based on optimistic mirror descent, with\r the following
  desirable properties: (\\emph{i}) they\r do not require \\emph{any} prior tuning
  or knowledge\r of the game; (\\emph{ii}) they all achieve\r $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$
  regret against arbitrary,\r adversarial opponents; and (\\emph{iii}) they\r converge
  to the best response against convergent\r opponents. Also, if employed by all players,
  then\r (\\emph{iv}) they guarantee $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\r \\emph{social} regret; while
  (\\emph{v}) the induced\r sequence of play converges to Nash equilibirum with\r
  $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ \\emph{individual} regret in all\r variationally stable games
  (a class of games that\r includes all monotone and convex-concave zero-sum\r games)."
