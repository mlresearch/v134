title: 'Adaptive Learning in Continuous Games: Optimal Regret Bounds and Convergence
  to Nash Equilibrium'
abstract: 'In game-theoretic learning, several agents are simultaneously following
  their individual interests, so the environment is non-stationary from each playerâ€™s
  perspective. In this context, the performance of a learning algorithm is often measured
  by its regret. However, no-regret algorithms are not created equal in terms of game-theoretic
  guarantees: depending on how they are tuned, some of them may drive the system to
  an equilibrium, while others could produce cyclic, chaotic, or otherwise divergent
  trajectories. To account for this, we propose a range of no-regret policies based
  on optimistic mirror descent, with the following desirable properties: (\emph{i})
  they do not require \emph{any} prior tuning or knowledge of the game; (\emph{ii})
  they all achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret against arbitrary, adversarial opponents;
  and (\emph{iii}) they converge to the best response against convergent opponents.
  Also, if employed by all players, then (\emph{iv}) they guarantee $\mathcal{O}(1)$
  \emph{social} regret; while (\emph{v}) the induced sequence of play converges to
  Nash equilibirum with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ \emph{individual} regret in all variationally
  stable games (a class of games that includes all monotone and convex-concave zero-sum
  games).'
