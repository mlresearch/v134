title: Exact Recovery of Clusters in Finite Metric Spaces Using Oracle Queries
abstract: We investigate the problem of exact cluster recovery using oracle queries.  Previous
  results show that clusters in Euclidean spaces that are convex and separated with
  a margin can be reconstructed exactly using only $O(\log n)$ same-cluster queries,
  where $n$ is the number of input points.  In this work, we study this problem in
  the more challenging non-convex setting. We introduce a structural characterization
  of clusters, called $(\beta,\gamma)$-convexity, that can be applied to any finite
  set of points equipped with a metric (or even a semimetric, as the triangle inequality
  is not needed).  Using $(\beta,\gamma)$-convexity, we can translate natural density
  properties of clusters (which include, for instance, clusters that are strongly
  non-convex in $R^d$) into a graph-theoretic notion of convexity.  By exploiting
  this convexity notion, we design a deterministic algorithm that recovers $(\beta,\gamma)$-convex
  clusters using $O(k^2 \log n + k^2 (\frac{6}{\beta\gamma})^{dens(X)})$ same-cluster
  queries, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $dens(X)$ is the density dimension
  of the semimetric.  We show that an exponential dependence on the density dimension
  is necessary, and we also show that, if we are allowed to make $O(k^2 + k \log n)$
  additional queries to a "cluster separation" oracle, then we can recover clusters
  that have different and arbitrary scales, even when the scale of each cluster is
  unknown.
