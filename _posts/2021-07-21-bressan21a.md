title: "Exact Recovery of Clusters in Finite Metric Spaces\r Using Oracle Queries"
abstract: "We investigate the problem of exact cluster recovery\r using oracle queries.
  \ Previous results show that\r clusters in Euclidean spaces that are convex and\r
  separated with a margin can be reconstructed exactly\r using only $O(\\log n)$ same-cluster
  queries, where\r $n$ is the number of input points.  In this work, we\r study this
  problem in the more challenging\r non-convex setting. We introduce a structural\r
  characterization of clusters, called\r $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convexity, that can be
  applied to\r any finite set of points equipped with a metric (or\r even a semimetric,
  as the triangle inequality is not\r needed).  Using $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convexity,
  we can\r translate natural density properties of clusters\r (which include, for
  instance, clusters that are\r strongly non-convex in $R^d$) into a graph-theoretic\r
  notion of convexity.  By exploiting this convexity\r notion, we design a deterministic
  algorithm that\r recovers $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convex clusters using\r $O(k^2 \\log
  n + k^2\r (\\frac{6}{\\beta\\gamma})^{dens(X)})$ same-cluster\r queries, where $k$
  is the number of clusters and\r $dens(X)$ is the density dimension of the\r semimetric.
  \ We show that an exponential dependence\r on the density dimension is necessary,
  and we also\r show that, if we are allowed to make $O(k^2 + k \\log\r n)$ additional
  queries to a \"cluster separation\"\r oracle, then we can recover clusters that
  have\r different and arbitrary scales, even when the scale\r of each cluster is
  unknown."
