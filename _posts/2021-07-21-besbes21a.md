title: Online Learning from Optimal Actions
abstract: We study the problem of online contextual optimization where, at each period,
  instead of observing the loss, we observe, after-the-fact, the optimal action an
  oracle with full knowledge of the objective function would have taken. At each period,
  the decision-maker has access to a new set of feasible actions to select from and
  to a new contextual function that affects that periodâ€™s loss function. We aim to
  minimize regret, which is defined as the difference between our losses and the ones
  incurred by an all-knowing oracle. We obtain the first regret bound for this problem
  that is logarithmic in the time horizon. Our results are derived through the development
  and analysis of a novel algorithmic structure that leverages the underlying geometry
  of the problem.
