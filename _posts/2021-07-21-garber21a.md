title: Frank-Wolfe with a Nearest Extreme Point Oracle
abstract: "We consider variants of the classical Frank-Wolfe\r algorithm for constrained
  smooth convex\r minimization, that instead of access to the standard\r oracle for
  minimizing a linear function over the\r feasible set, have access to an oracle that
  can find\r an extreme point of the feasible set that is closest\r in Euclidean distance
  to a given vector. We first\r show that for many feasible sets of interest, such\r
  an oracle can be implemented with the same\r complexity as the standard linear optimization\r
  oracle. We then show that with such an oracle we can\r design new Frank-Wolfe variants
  which enjoy\r significantly improved complexity bounds in case the\r set of optimal
  solutions lies in the convex hull of\r a subset of extreme points with small diameter\r
  (e.g., a low-dimensional face of a polytope). In\r particular, for many $0\\text{â€“}1$
  polytopes, under\r quadratic growth and strict complementarity\r conditions, we
  obtain the first linearly convergent\r variant with rate that depends only on the
  dimension\r of the optimal face and not on the ambient\r dimension."
