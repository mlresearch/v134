title: "Rank-one matrix estimation: analytic time evolution\r of gradient descent
  dynamics"
abstract: "We consider a rank-one symmetric matrix corrupted by\r additive noise.
  The rank-one matrix is formed by an\r n-component unknown vector on the sphere of
  radius\r sqrt(n), and we consider the problem of estimating\r this vector from the
  corrupted matrix in the high\r dimensional limit of n large, by gradient descent\r
  for a quadratic cost function on the sphere.\r Explicit formulas for the whole time
  evolution of\r the overlap between the estimator and unknown\r vector, as well as
  the cost, are rigorously\r derived. In the long time limit we recover the well\r
  known spectral phase transition, as a function of\r the signal-to-noise ratio. The
  explicit formulas\r also allow to point out interesting transient\r features of
  the time evolution. Our analysis\r technique is based on recent progress in random\r
  matrix theory and uses local versions of the\r semi-circle law."
