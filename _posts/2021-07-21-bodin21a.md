title: 'Rank-one matrix estimation: analytic time evolution of gradient descent dynamics'
abstract: We consider a rank-one symmetric matrix corrupted by additive noise. The
  rank-one matrix is formed by an n-component unknown vector on the sphere of radius
  $\sqrt{n}$, and we consider the problem of estimating this vector from the corrupted
  matrix in the high dimensional limit of $n$ large, by gradient descent for a quadratic
  cost function on the sphere. Explicit formulas for the whole time evolution of the
  overlap between the estimator and unknown vector, as well as the cost, are rigorously
  derived. In the long time limit we recover the well known spectral phase transition,
  as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The explicit formulas also allow to
  point out interesting transient features of the time evolution. Our analysis technique
  is based on recent progress in random matrix theory and uses local versions of the
  semi-circle law.
