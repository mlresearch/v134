title: Softmax Policy Gradient Methods Can Take Exponential Time to Converge
abstract: The softmax policy gradient (PG) method, which performs gradient ascent
  under softmax policy parameterization, is arguably one of the de facto implementations
  of policy optimization in modern reinforcement learning. For $\gamma$-discounted
  infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs), remarkable progress has
  recently been achieved towards establishing global convergence of softmax PG methods
  in finding a near-optimal policy. However, prior results fall short of delineating
  clear dependencies of convergence rates on salient parameters such as the cardinality
  of the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$,
  both of which could be excessively large. In this paper, we deliver a pessimistic
  message regarding the iteration complexity of softmax PG methods, despite assuming
  access to exact gradient computation. Specifically, we demonstrate that the softmax
  PG method with stepsize $\eta$ can take \[ \frac{1}{\eta} |\mathcal{S}|^{2^{\Omega\big(\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\big)}}
  Â \text{iterations} \]{to} converge, even in the presence of a benign policy initialization
  and an initial state distribution amenable to exploration (so that the distribution
  mismatch coefficient is not exceedingly large). This is accomplished by characterizing
  the algorithmic dynamics over a carefully-constructed MDP containing only three
  actions. Our exponential lower bound hints at the necessity of carefully adjusting
  update rules or enforcing proper regularization in accelerating PG methods.
