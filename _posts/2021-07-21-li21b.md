title: "Softmax Policy Gradient Methods Can Take Exponential\r Time to Converge"
abstract: "The softmax policy gradient (PG) method, which\r performs gradient ascent
  under softmax policy\r parameterization, is arguably one of the de facto\r implementations
  of policy optimization in modern\r reinforcement learning. For $\\gamma$-discounted\r
  infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes\r (MDPs), remarkable progress
  has recently been\r achieved towards establishing global convergence of\r softmax
  PG methods in finding a near-optimal\r policy. However, prior results fall short
  of\r delineating clear dependencies of convergence rates\r on salient parameters
  such as the cardinality of the\r state space $\\mathcal{S}$ and the effective horizon\r
  $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$, both of which could be\r excessively large. In this paper,
  we deliver a\r pessimistic message regarding the iteration\r complexity of softmax
  PG methods, despite assuming\r access to exact gradient computation. Specifically,\r
  we demonstrate that the softmax PG method with\r stepsize $\\eta$ can take \\[ \\frac{1}{\\eta}\r
  |\\mathcal{S}|^{2^{\\Omega\\big(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\big)}}\r Â \\text{iterations}
  \\]{to} converge, even in the\r presence of a benign policy initialization and an\r
  initial state distribution amenable to exploration\r (so that the distribution mismatch
  coefficient is\r not exceedingly large). This is accomplished by\r characterizing
  the algorithmic dynamics over a\r carefully-constructed MDP containing only three\r
  actions. Our exponential lower bound hints at the\r necessity of carefully adjusting
  update rules or\r enforcing proper regularization in accelerating PG\r methods."
