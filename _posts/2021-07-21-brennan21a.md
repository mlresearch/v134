title: "Statistical Query Algorithms and Low Degree Tests\r Are Almost Equivalent"
abstract: "Researchers currently use a number of approaches to\r predict and substantiate
  information-computation\r gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation\r problems.
  A prominent approach is to characterize\r the limits of restricted models of computation,\r
  which on the one hand yields strong computational\r lower bounds for powerful classes
  of algorithms and\r on the other hand helps guide the development of\r efficient
  algorithms. In this paper, we study two of\r the most popular restricted computational
  models,\r the statistical query framework and low-degree\r polynomials, in the context
  of high-dimensional\r hypothesis testing. Our main result is that under\r mild conditions
  on the testing problem, the two\r classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent
  in\r power. As corollaries, we obtain new statistical\r query lower bounds for sparse
  PCA, tensor PCA and\r several variants of the planted clique problem."
