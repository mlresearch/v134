title: Statistical Query Algorithms and Low Degree Tests Are Almost Equivalent
abstract: Researchers currently use a number of approaches to predict and substantiate
  information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation problems.
  A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted models of computation,
  which on the one hand yields strong computational lower bounds for powerful classes
  of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the development of efficient algorithms.
  In this paper, we study two of the most popular restricted computational models,
  the statistical query framework and low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional
  hypothesis testing. Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing
  problem, the two classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power. As corollaries,
  we obtain new statistical query lower bounds for sparse PCA, tensor PCA and several
  variants of the planted clique problem.
