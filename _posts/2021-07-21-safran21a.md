title: The Effects of Mild Over-parameterization on the Optimization Landscape of
  Shallow ReLU Neural Networks
abstract: We study the effects of mild over-parameterization on the optimization landscape
  of a simple ReLU neural network of the form $\mathbf{x}\mapsto\sum_{i=1}^k\max\{0,\mathbf{w}_i^{\top}\mathbf{x}\}$,
  in a well-studied teacher-student setting where the target values are generated
  by the same architecture, and when directly optimizing over the population squared
  loss with respect to Gaussian inputs. We prove that while the objective is strongly
  convex around the global minima when the teacher and student networks possess the
  same number of neurons, it is not even \emph{locally convex} after any amount of
  over-parameterization. Moreover, related desirable properties (e.g., one-point strong
  convexity and the Polyak-{≈Å}ojasiewicz condition) also do not hold even locally.
  On the other hand, we establish that the objective remains one-point strongly convex
  in \emph{most} directions (suitably defined), and show an optimization guarantee
  under this property. For the non-global minima, we prove that adding even just a
  single neuron will turn a non-global minimum into a saddle point. This holds under
  some technical conditions which we validate empirically.  These results provide
  a possible explanation for why recovering a global minimum becomes significantly
  easier when we over-parameterize, even if the amount of over-parameterization is
  very moderate.
