title: "The Effects of Mild Over-parameterization on the\r Optimization Landscape
  of Shallow ReLU Neural\r Networks"
abstract: "We study the effects of mild over-parameterization\r on the optimization
  landscape of a simple ReLU\r neural network of the form\r $\\mathbf{x}\\mapsto\\sum_{i=1}^k\\max\\{0,\\mathbf{w}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}\\}$,\r
  in a well-studied teacher-student setting where the\r target values are generated
  by the same\r architecture, and when directly optimizing over the\r population squared
  loss with respect to Gaussian\r inputs. We prove that while the objective is\r strongly
  convex around the global minima when the\r teacher and student networks possess
  the same number\r of neurons, it is not even \\emph{locally convex}\r after any
  amount of over-parameterization. Moreover,\r related desirable properties (e.g.,
  one-point strong\r convexity and the Polyak-{≈Å}ojasiewicz condition)\r also do not
  hold even locally. On the other hand, we\r establish that the objective remains
  one-point\r strongly convex in \\emph{most} directions (suitably\r defined), and
  show an optimization guarantee under\r this property. For the non-global minima,
  we prove\r that adding even just a single neuron will turn a\r non-global minimum
  into a saddle point. This holds\r under some technical conditions which we validate\r
  empirically.  These results provide a possible\r explanation for why recovering
  a global minimum\r becomes significantly easier when we\r over-parameterize, even
  if the amount of\r over-parameterization is very moderate."
