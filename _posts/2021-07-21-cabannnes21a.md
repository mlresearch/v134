title: Fast Rates for Structured Prediction
abstract: "Discrete supervised learning problems such as\r classification are often
  tackled by introducing a\r continuous surrogate problem akin to\r regression. Bounding
  the original error, between\r estimate and solution, by the surrogate error endows\r
  discrete problems with convergence rates already\r shown for continuous instances.
  Yet, current\r approaches do not leverage the fact that discrete\r problems are
  essentially predicting a discrete\r output when continuous problems are predicting
  a\r continuous value. In this paper, we tackle this\r issue for general structured
  prediction problems,\r opening the way to “super fast” rates, that is,\r convergence
  rates for the excess risk faster than\r $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of observations,\r
  with even exponential rates with the strongest\r assumptions. We first illustrate
  it for predictors\r based on nearest neighbors, generalizing rates known\r for binary
  classification to any discrete problem\r within the framework of structured prediction.
  We\r then consider kernel ridge regression where we\r improve known rates in $n^{-1/4}$
  to arbitrarily\r fast rates, depending on a parameter characterizing\r the hardness
  of the problem, thus allowing, under\r smoothness assumptions, to bypass the curse
  of\r dimensionality."
