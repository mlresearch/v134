title: Fast Rates for Structured Prediction
abstract: Discrete supervised learning problems such as classification are often tackled
  by introducing a continuous surrogate problem akin to regression. Bounding the original
  error, between estimate and solution, by the surrogate error endows discrete problems
  with convergence rates already shown for continuous instances. Yet, current approaches
  do not leverage the fact that discrete problems are essentially predicting a discrete
  output when continuous problems are predicting a continuous value. In this paper,
  we tackle this issue for general structured prediction problems, opening the way
  to “super fast” rates, that is, convergence rates for the excess risk faster than
  $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of observations, with even exponential rates with
  the strongest assumptions. We first illustrate it for predictors based on nearest
  neighbors, generalizing rates known for binary classification to any discrete problem
  within the framework of structured prediction. We then consider kernel ridge regression
  where we improve known rates in $n^{-1/4}$ to arbitrarily fast rates, depending
  on a parameter characterizing the hardness of the problem, thus allowing, under
  smoothness assumptions, to bypass the curse of dimensionality.
