title: A Theory of Heuristic Learnability
abstract: "Which concepts can we learn efficiently on average?\r In this paper, we
  investigate the capability of a\r natural average-case learning framework, heuristic\r
  PAC (heurPAC) learning to answer this and some other\r related questions. Roughly
  speaking, we say that a\r concept class is heurPAC learnable if there exists a\r
  learning algorithm that given $n, s\\in\\mathbb{N}$\r and $\\epsilon,\\delta,\\eta\\in(0,1]$
  as input, learns\r all but $\\eta$ fraction of $n$-input target\r functions represented
  as $s$-bit strings in the\r class from passively collected examples and then\r outputs
  an $\\epsilon$-close hypothesis with failure\r probability at most $\\delta$ in
  polynomial-time in\r $n$, $s$, $\\epsilon^{-1},\\delta^{-1}$, and\r $\\eta^{-1}$,
  where each example is generated\r according to some example distribution.  First,
  we\r establish a positive learnability\r result. Specifically, we show that a simple\r
  Fourier-based algorithm heurPAC learns $\\Omega(\\log\r n)$-junta functions on the
  uniform distribution,\r which is a central open question in the original PAC\r learning
  model. Our technical contribution is to\r introduce the notion of elusive functions
  that\r captures hard-to-learn cases and to establish a\r polynomial relation between
  the running time and the\r fraction of such elusive functions. Second, we\r present
  clear relations between heurPAC learnability\r and cryptography. Particularly, we
  show that for any\r efficiently evaluated class $\\mathscr{C}$, (1) if\r $\\mathscr{C}$
  is not heurPAC learnable, then an\r auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) exists;
  (2)\r if $\\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable on the\r uniform distribution,
  then an infinitely-often\r one-way function (io-OWF) exists. As a corollary, we\r
  also present new characterizations for AIOWF and\r io-OWF based on heurPAC learnability,
  which is\r conceptually stronger than the previous ones that\r are based on average-case
  learnability for fixed\r parameters. These results show that our framework\r might
  yield heuristic learners with theoretical\r guarantees for broader classes than
  the usual PAC\r learning framework, and any efficiently evaluated\r class has a
  potential for such a heuristic learner\r or a secure cryptographic primitive. Through
  this\r paper, we suggest further research toward the\r win-win “learning vs. cryptography”
  paradigm."
