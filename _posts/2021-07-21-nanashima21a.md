title: A Theory of Heuristic Learnability
abstract: Which concepts can we learn efficiently on average? In this paper, we investigate
  the capability of a natural average-case learning framework, heuristic PAC (heurPAC)
  learning to answer this and some other related questions. Roughly speaking, we say
  that a concept class is heurPAC learnable if there exists a learning algorithm that
  given $n, s\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon,\delta,\eta\in(0,1]$ as input, learns all
  but $\eta$ fraction of $n$-input target functions represented as $s$-bit strings
  in the class from passively collected examples and then outputs an $\epsilon$-close
  hypothesis with failure probability at most $\delta$ in polynomial-time in $n$,
  $s$, $\epsilon^{-1},\delta^{-1}$, and $\eta^{-1}$, where each example is generated
  according to some example distribution.  First, we establish a positive learnability
  result. Specifically, we show that a simple Fourier-based algorithm heurPAC learns
  $\Omega(\log n)$-junta functions on the uniform distribution, which is a central
  open question in the original PAC learning model. Our technical contribution is
  to introduce the notion of elusive functions that captures hard-to-learn cases and
  to establish a polynomial relation between the running time and the fraction of
  such elusive functions. Second, we present clear relations between heurPAC learnability
  and cryptography. Particularly, we show that for any efficiently evaluated class
  $\mathscr{C}$, (1) if $\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable, then an auxiliary-input
  one-way function (AIOWF) exists; (2) if $\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable on
  the uniform distribution, then an infinitely-often one-way function (io-OWF) exists.
  As a corollary, we also present new characterizations for AIOWF and io-OWF based
  on heurPAC learnability, which is conceptually stronger than the previous ones that
  are based on average-case learnability for fixed parameters. These results show
  that our framework might yield heuristic learners with theoretical guarantees for
  broader classes than the usual PAC learning framework, and any efficiently evaluated
  class has a potential for such a heuristic learner or a secure cryptographic primitive.
  Through this paper, we suggest further research toward the win-win “learning vs.
  cryptography” paradigm.
