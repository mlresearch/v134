title: "Generalizing Complex Hypotheses on Product\r Distributions: Auctions, Prophet
  Inequalities, and\r Pandora’s Problem"
abstract: "This paper explores a theory of generalization for\r learning problems
  on product distributions,\r complementing the existing learning theories in the\r
  sense that it does not rely on any complexity\r measures of the hypothesis classes.
  \ The main\r contributions are two general sample complexity\r bounds: (1) $\\tilde{O}
  \\big( \\frac{nk}{\\epsilon^2}\r \\big)$ samples are sufficient and necessary for\r
  learning an $\\epsilon$-optimal hypothesis in\r \\emph{any problem} on an $n$-dimensional
  product\r distribution, whose marginals have finite supports\r of sizes at most
  $k$; (2) $\\tilde{O} \\big(\r \\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2} \\big)$ samples are sufficient\r
  and necessary for any problem on $n$-dimensional\r product distributions if it satisfies
  a notion of\r strong monotonicity from the algorithmic game theory\r literature.
  \ As applications of these theories, we\r match the optimal sample complexity for\r
  single-parameter revenue maximization (Guo et al.,\r STOC 2019), improve the state-of-the-art
  for\r multi-parameter revenue maximization (Gonczarowski\r and Weinberg, FOCS 2018)
  and prophet inequality\r (Correa et al., EC 2019; Rubinstein et al., ITCS\r 2020),
  and provide the first and tight sample\r complexity bound for Pandora’s problem."
