title: 'Generalizing Complex Hypotheses on Product Distributions: Auctions, Prophet
  Inequalities, and Pandora’s Problem'
abstract: 'This paper explores a theory of generalization for learning problems on
  product distributions, complementing the existing learning theories in the sense
  that it does not rely on any complexity measures of the hypothesis classes.  The
  main contributions are two general sample complexity bounds: (1) $\tilde{O} \big(
  \frac{nk}{\epsilon^2} \big)$ samples are sufficient and necessary for learning an
  $\epsilon$-optimal hypothesis in \emph{any problem} on an $n$-dimensional product
  distribution, whose marginals have finite supports of sizes at most $k$; (2) $\tilde{O}
  \big( \frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \big)$ samples are sufficient and necessary for any problem
  on $n$-dimensional product distributions if it satisfies a notion of strong monotonicity
  from the algorithmic game theory literature.  As applications of these theories,
  we match the optimal sample complexity for single-parameter revenue maximization
  (Guo et al., STOC 2019), improve the state-of-the-art for multi-parameter revenue
  maximization (Gonczarowski and Weinberg, FOCS 2018) and prophet inequality (Correa
  et al., EC 2019; Rubinstein et al., ITCS 2020), and provide the first and tight
  sample complexity bound for Pandora’s problem.'
