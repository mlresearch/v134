title: 'Efficient Bandit Convex Optimization: Beyond Linear Losses'
abstract: 'We study the problem of online learning with bandit feedback, where a learner
  aims to minimize a sequence of adversarially generated loss functions, while only
  observing the value of each function at a single point. When the loss functions
  chosen by the adversary are convex and quadratic, we develop a new algorithm which
  achieves the optimal regret rate of $O{T^{1/2}}$. Furthermore, our algorithm satisfies
  three important desiderata: (a) it is practical and can be efficiently implemented
  for high dimensional problems, (b) the regret bound holds with high probability
  even against adaptive adversaries whose decisions can depend on the learner’s previous
  actions, and (c) it is robust to model mis-specification; that is, the regret bound
  degrades gracefully when the loss functions deviate from convex quadratics.  To
  the best of our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm for bandit convex optimization
  with quadratic losses which is efficiently implementable and achieves optimal regret
  guarantees. Existing algorithms for this problem either have sub-optimal regret
  guarantees or are computationally expensive and do not scale well to high-dimensional
  problems.  Our algorithm is a bandit version of the classical regularized Newton’s
  method. It involves estimation of gradients and Hessians of the loss functions from
  single point feedback. A key caveat of working with Hessian estimates however is
  that they typically have large variance. In this work, we show that it is nonetheless
  possible to finesse this caveat by relying on the idea of “focus regions”, where
  we restrict the algorithm to choose actions from a subset of the action space in
  which the variance of our estimates can be controlled.'
