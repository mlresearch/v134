title: "Efficient Bandit Convex Optimization: Beyond Linear\r Losses"
abstract: "We study the problem of online learning with bandit\r feedback, where a
  learner aims to minimize a\r sequence of adversarially generated loss functions,\r
  while only observing the value of each function at a\r single point. When the loss
  functions chosen by the\r adversary are convex and quadratic, we develop a new\r
  algorithm which achieves the optimal regret rate of\r $O{T^{1/2}}$. Furthermore,
  our algorithm satisfies\r three important desiderata: (a) it is practical and\r
  can be efficiently implemented for high dimensional\r problems, (b) the regret bound
  holds with high\r probability even against adaptive adversaries whose\r decisions
  can depend on the learner’s previous\r actions, and (c) it is robust to model\r
  mis-specification; that is, the regret bound\r degrades gracefully when the loss
  functions deviate\r from convex quadratics.  To the best of our\r knowledge, ours
  is the first algorithm for bandit\r convex optimization with quadratic losses which
  is\r efficiently implementable and achieves optimal\r regret guarantees. Existing
  algorithms for this\r problem either have sub-optimal regret guarantees or\r are
  computationally expensive and do not scale well\r to high-dimensional problems.
  \ Our algorithm is a\r bandit version of the classical regularized Newton’s\r method.
  It involves estimation of gradients and\r Hessians of the loss functions from single
  point\r feedback. A key caveat of working with Hessian\r estimates however is that
  they typically have large\r variance. In this work, we show that it is\r nonetheless
  possible to finesse this caveat by\r relying on the idea of “focus regions”, where
  we\r restrict the algorithm to choose actions from a\r subset of the action space
  in which the variance of\r our estimates can be controlled."
