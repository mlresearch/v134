title: "Weak learning convex sets under normal\r distributions"
abstract: "This paper addresses the following natural question:\r can efficient algorithms
  weakly learn convex sets\r under normal distributions? Strong learnability of\r
  convex sets under normal distributions is well\r understood, with near-matching
  upper and lower\r bounds given by Klivans et al (2008), but prior to\r the current
  work nothing seems to have been known\r about weak learning. We essentially answer
  this\r question, giving near-matching algorithms and lower\r bounds.  For our positive
  result, we give a\r poly(n)-time algorithm that can weakly learn the\r class of
  convex sets to advantage\r $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$ using only random examples\r drawn
  from the background Gaussian distribution. Our\r algorithm and analysis are based
  on a new “density\r increment” result for convex sets, which we prove\r using tools
  from isoperimetry.  We also give an\r information-theoretic lower bound showing
  that\r $O(\\log(n)/\\sqrt{n})$ advantage is best possible\r even for algorithms
  that are allowed to make poly(n)\r many membership queries."
