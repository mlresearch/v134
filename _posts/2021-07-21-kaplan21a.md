title: The Sparse Vector Technique, Revisited
abstract: "We revisit one of the most basic and widely\r applicable techniques in
  the literature of\r differential privacy â€“ the sparse vector technique\r [Dwork
  et al., STOC 2009]. This simple algorithm\r privately tests whether the value of
  a given query\r on a database is close to what we expect it to\r be. It allows to
  ask an unbounded number of queries\r as long as the answer is close to what we expect,\r
  and halts following the first query for which this\r is not the case.  We suggest
  an alternative, equally\r simple, algorithm that can continue testing queries\r
  as long as any single individual does not contribute\r to the answer of too many
  queries whose answer\r deviates substantially form what we expect. Our\r analysis
  is subtle and some of its ingredients may\r be more widely applicable.  In some
  cases our new\r algorithm allows to privately extract much more\r information from
  the database than the original.  We\r demonstrate this by applying our algorithm
  to the\r shifting-heavy-hitters problem: On every time step,\r each of n users gets
  a new input, and the task is to\r privately identify all the current\r heavy-hitters.
  That is, on time step i, the goal is\r to identify all data elements x such that
  many of\r the users have x as their current input. We present\r an algorithm for
  this problem with improved error\r guarantees over what can be obtained using existing\r
  techniques. Specifically, the error of our algorithm\r depends on the maximal number
  of times that a single\r user holds a heavy-hitter as input, rather than the\r total
  number of times in which a heavy-hitter\r exists."
