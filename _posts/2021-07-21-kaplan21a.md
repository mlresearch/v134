title: The Sparse Vector Technique, Revisited
abstract: 'We revisit one of the most basic and widely applicable techniques in the
  literature of differential privacy â€“ the sparse vector technique [Dwork et al.,
  STOC 2009]. This simple algorithm privately tests whether the value of a given query
  on a database is close to what we expect it to be. It allows to ask an unbounded
  number of queries as long as the answer is close to what we expect, and halts following
  the first query for which this is not the case.  We suggest an alternative, equally
  simple, algorithm that can continue testing queries as long as any single individual
  does not contribute to the answer of too many queries whose answer deviates substantially
  form what we expect. Our analysis is subtle and some of its ingredients may be more
  widely applicable.  In some cases our new algorithm allows to privately extract
  much more information from the database than the original.  We demonstrate this
  by applying our algorithm to the shifting-heavy-hitters problem: On every time step,
  each of n users gets a new input, and the task is to privately identify all the
  current heavy-hitters. That is, on time step i, the goal is to identify all data
  elements x such that many of the users have x as their current input. We present
  an algorithm for this problem with improved error guarantees over what can be obtained
  using existing techniques. Specifically, the error of our algorithm depends on the
  maximal number of times that a single user holds a heavy-hitter as input, rather
  than the total number of times in which a heavy-hitter exists.'
