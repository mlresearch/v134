title: "Improved Analysis of the Tsallis-INF Algorithm in\r Stochastically Constrained
  Adversarial Bandits and\r Stochastic Bandits with Adversarial Corruptions"
abstract: "We derive improved regret bounds for the Tsallis-INF\r algorithm of \\citet{zimmert2020}.
  We show that in\r adversarial regimes with a $(\\Delta,C,T)$\r self-bounding constraint
  the algorithm achieves\r $\\Ocal\\lr{\\lr{\\sum_{i\\neq i^*}\r \\frac{1}{\\Delta_i}}\\log_+\\lr{\\frac{(K-1)T}{\\lr{\\sum_{i\\neq\r
  i^*} \\frac{1}{\\Delta_i}}^2}}+\\sqrt{C\\lr{\\sum_{i\\neq\r i^*}\\frac{1}{\\Delta_i}}\\log_+\\lr{\\frac{(K-1)T}{C\\sum_{i\\neq\r
  i^*}\\frac{1}{\\Delta_i}}}}}$ regret bound, where $T$\r is the time horizon, $K$
  is the number of arms,\r $\\Delta_i$ are the suboptimality gaps, $i^*$ is the\r
  best arm, $C$ is the corruption magnitude, and\r $\\log_+(x) = \\max\\lr{1,\\log
  x}$. The regime includes\r stochastic bandits, stochastically constrained\r adversarial
  bandits, and stochastic bandits with\r adversarial corruptions as special cases.\r
  Additionally, we provide a general analysis, which\r allows to achieve the same
  kind of improvement for\r generalizations of Tsallis-INF to other settings\r beyond
  multiarmed bandits."
