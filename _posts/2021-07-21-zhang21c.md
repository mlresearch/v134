title: "Is Reinforcement Learning More Difficult Than\r Bandits? A Near-optimal Algorithm
  Escaping the Curse\r of Horizon"
abstract: "Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual\r bandits are two widely
  studied sequential\r decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement\r learning
  generalizes contextual bandits and is often\r perceived to be more difficult due
  to long planning\r horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The\r current
  paper shows that the long planning horizon\r and the unknown state-dependent transitions
  (at\r most) pose little additional difficulty on sample\r complexity.  We consider
  the episodic reinforcement\r learning with S states, A actions, planning horizon\r
  H, total reward bounded by 1, and the agent plays\r for K episodes. We propose a
  new algorithm,\r Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP), which relies on a\r new Bernstein-type
  bonus. The new bonus only\r requires tweaking the constants to ensure optimism\r
  and thus is significantly simpler than existing\r bonus constructions. We show MVP
  enjoys an\r $O\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{SAK} + S^2A\\right) \\poly\\log\r \\left(SAHK\\right)\\right)$
  regret, approaching the\r $\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{SAK}\\right)$ lower bound of\r contextual
  bandits. Notably, this result 1)\r exponentially improves the state-of-the-art\r
  polynomial-time algorithms by Dann et al. [2019],\r Zanette et al. [2019], and Zhang
  et al. [2020] in\r terms of the dependency on H, and 2) exponentially\r improves
  the running time in [Wang et al. 2020] and\r significantly improves the dependency
  on S, A and K\r in sample complexity."
