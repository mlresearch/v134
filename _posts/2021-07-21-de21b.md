title: "Learning sparse mixtures of permutations from noisy\r information"
abstract: "We study the problem of learning an unknown mixture\r of k permutations
  over n elements, given access to\r noisy samples drawn from the unknown mixture.
  We\r consider a range of different noise models,\r including natural variants of
  the “heat kernel”\r noise framework and the Mallows model. We give an\r algorithm
  which, for each of these noise models,\r learns the unknown mixture to high accuracy
  under\r mild assumptions and runs in n^{O(log k)} time. Our\r approach is based
  on a new procedure that recovers\r an unknown mixture of permutations from noisy\r
  higher-order marginals."
