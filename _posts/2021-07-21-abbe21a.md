title: Stochastic block model entropy and broadcasting on trees with survey
abstract: The limit of the entropy in the stochastic block model (SBM) has been characterized
  in the sparse regime for the special case of disassortative communities [Coja-Oghlan
  et al. (2017)] and for the classical case of assortative communities but in the
  dense regime [Deshpande et al. (2016)]. The problem has not been closed in the classical
  sparse and assortative case. This paper establishes the result in this case for
  any SNR besides for the interval (1, 3.513). It further gives an approximation to
  the limit in this window.  The result is obtained by expressing the global SBM entropy
  as an integral of local tree entropies in a broadcasting on tree model with erasure
  side-information. The main technical advancement then relies on showing the irrelevance
  of the boundary in such a model, also studied with variants in [Kanade et al. (2016)],
  [Mossel et al. (2016)] and [Mossel and Xu (2015)]. In particular, we establish the
  uniqueness of the BP fixed point in the survey model for any SNR above 3.513 or
  below 1. This only leaves a narrow region in the plane between SNR and survey strength
  where the uniqueness of BP conjectured in these papers remains unproved.
