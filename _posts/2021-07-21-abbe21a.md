title: "Stochastic block model entropy and broadcasting on\r trees with survey"
abstract: "The limit of the entropy in the stochastic block\r model (SBM) has been
  characterized in the sparse\r regime for the special case of disassortative\r communities
  [Coja-Oghlan et al. (2017)] and for the\r classical case of assortative communities
  but in the\r dense regime [Deshpande et al. (2016)]. The problem\r has not been
  closed in the classical sparse and\r assortative case. This paper establishes the
  result\r in this case for any SNR besides for the interval\r (1, 3.513). It further
  gives an approximation to the\r limit in this window.  The result is obtained by\r
  expressing the global SBM entropy as an integral of\r local tree entropies in a
  broadcasting on tree model\r with erasure side-information. The main technical\r
  advancement then relies on showing the irrelevance\r of the boundary in such a model,
  also studied with\r variants in [Kanade et al. (2016)], [Mossel et\r al. (2016)]
  and [Mossel and Xu (2015)]. In\r particular, we establish the uniqueness of the
  BP\r fixed point in the survey model for any SNR above\r 3.513 or below 1. This
  only leaves a narrow region\r in the plane between SNR and survey strength where\r
  the uniqueness of BP conjectured in these papers\r remains unproved."
