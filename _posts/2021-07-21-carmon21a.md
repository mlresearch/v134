title: "Thinking Inside the Ball: Near-Optimal Minimization\r of the Maximal Loss"
abstract: "We characterize the complexity of minimizing\r $\\max_{i\\in[N]} f_i(x)$
  for convex, Lipschitz\r functions $f_1,\\ldots, f_N$.  % For non-smooth\r functions,
  existing methods require\r $O(N\\epsilon^{-2})$ queries to a first-order oracle\r
  to compute an $\\epsilon$-suboptimal point and\r $\\widetilde{O}(N\\epsilon^{-1})$
  queries if the $f_i$\r are $O(1/\\epsilon)$-smooth.  % We develop methods\r with
  improved complexity bounds of\r $\\widetilde{O}(N\\epsilon^{-2/3} + \\epsilon^{-8/3})$\r
  in the non-smooth case and\r $\\widetilde{O}(N\\epsilon^{-2/3} +\r \\sqrt{N}\\epsilon^{-1})$
  in the\r $O(1/\\epsilon)$-smooth case.  % Our methods consist\r of a recently proposed
  ball optimization oracle\r acceleration algorithm (which we refine) and a\r careful
  implementation of said oracle for the\r softmax function.  % We also prove an oracle\r
  complexity lower bound scaling as\r $\\Omega(N\\epsilon^{-2/3})$, showing that our\r
  dependence on $N$ is optimal up to polylogarithmic\r factors."
