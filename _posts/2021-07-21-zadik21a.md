title: "It was “all” for “nothing”: sharp phase\r transitions for noiseless discrete
  channels"
abstract: "We prove a phase transition known as the\r “all-or-nothing” phenomenon
  for noiseless discrete\r channels. This class of models includes the\r Bernoulli
  group testing model and the planted\r Gaussian perceptron model. Previously, the
  existence\r of the all-or-nothing phenomenon for such models was\r only known in
  a limited range of parameters. Our\r work extends the results to all signals with\r
  sublinear sparsity.  Our main technique is to show\r that for such models, the “all”
  half of\r all-or-nothing implies the “nothing” half, so that\r a proof of “all”
  can be turned into a proof of\r “nothing.” Since the “all” half can often be\r proven
  by straightforward means, our equivalence\r gives a powerful and general approach
  towards\r establishing the existence of this phenomenon in\r other contexts."
