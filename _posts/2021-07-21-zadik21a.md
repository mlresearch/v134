title: 'It was “all” for “nothing”: sharp phase transitions for noiseless discrete
  channels'
abstract: We prove a phase transition known as the “all-or-nothing” phenomenon for
  noiseless discrete channels. This class of models includes the Bernoulli group testing
  model and the planted Gaussian perceptron model. Previously, the existence of the
  all-or-nothing phenomenon for such models was only known in a limited range of parameters.
  Our work extends the results to all signals with sublinear sparsity.  Our main technique
  is to show that for such models, the “all” half of all-or-nothing implies the “nothing”
  half, so that a proof of “all” can be turned into a proof of “nothing.” Since the
  “all” half can often be proven by straightforward means, our equivalence gives a
  powerful and general approach towards establishing the existence of this phenomenon
  in other contexts.
