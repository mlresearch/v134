title: Stochastic Approximation for Online Tensorial Independent Component Analysis
abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) has been a popular dimension reduction
  tool in statistical machine learning and signal processing. In this paper, we present
  a convergence analysis for an online tensorial ICA algorithm, by viewing the problem
  as a nonconvex stochastic approximation problem. For estimating one component, we
  provide a dynamics-based analysis to prove that our online tensorial ICA algorithm
  with a specific choice of stepsize achieves a sharp finite-sample error bound. In
  particular, under a mild assumption on the data-generating distribution and a scaling
  condition such that $d^4/T$ is sufficiently small up to a polylogarithmic factor
  of data dimension $d$ and sample size $T$, a sharp finite-sample error bound of
  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d/T})$ can be obtained.
