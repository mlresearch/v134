title: "Stochastic Approximation for Online Tensorial\r Independent Component Analysis"
abstract: "Independent component analysis (ICA) has been a\r popular dimension reduction
  tool in statistical\r machine learning and signal processing. In this\r paper, we
  present a convergence analysis for an\r online tensorial ICA algorithm, by viewing
  the\r problem as a nonconvex stochastic approximation\r problem. For estimating
  one component, we provide a\r dynamics-based analysis to prove that our online\r
  tensorial ICA algorithm with a specific choice of\r stepsize achieves a sharp finite-sample
  error\r bound. In particular, under a mild assumption on the\r data-generating distribution
  and a scaling condition\r such that $d^4/T$ is sufficiently small up to a\r polylogarithmic
  factor of data dimension $d$ and\r sample size $T$, a sharp finite-sample error
  bound\r of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d/T})$ can be obtained."
