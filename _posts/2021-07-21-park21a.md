title: Provable Memorization via Deep Neural Networks using Sub-linear Parameters
abstract: It is known that $O(N)$ parameters are sufficient for neural networks to
  memorize arbitrary $N$ input-label pairs. By exploiting depth, we show that $O(N^{2/3})$
  parameters suffice to memorize $N$ pairs, under a mild condition on the separation
  of input points. In particular, deeper networks (even with width 3) are shown to
  memorize more pairs than shallow networks, which also agrees with the recent line
  of works on the benefits of depth for function approximation. We also provide empirical
  results that support our theoretical findings.
