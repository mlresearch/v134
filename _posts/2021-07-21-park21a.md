title: "Provable Memorization via Deep Neural Networks using\r Sub-linear Parameters"
abstract: "It is known that $O(N)$ parameters are sufficient\r for neural networks
  to memorize arbitrary $N$\r input-label pairs. By exploiting depth, we show that\r
  $O(N^{2/3})$ parameters suffice to memorize $N$\r pairs, under a mild condition
  on the separation of\r input points. In particular, deeper networks (even\r with
  width 3) are shown to memorize more pairs than\r shallow networks, which also agrees
  with the recent\r line of works on the benefits of depth for function\r approximation.
  We also provide empirical results\r that support our theoretical findings."
