title: "Concentration of Non-Isotropic Random Tensors with\r Applications to Learning
  and Empirical Risk\r Minimization"
abstract: "Dimension is an inherent bottleneck to some modern\r learning tasks, where
  optimization methods suffer\r from the size of the data. In this paper, we study\r
  non-isotropic distributions of data and develop\r tools that aim at reducing these
  dimensional costs\r by a dependency on an effective dimension rather\r than the
  ambient one.  Based on non-asymptotic\r estimates of the metric entropy of ellipsoids
  -that\r prove to generalize to infinite dimensions- and on a\r chaining argument,
  our uniform concentration bounds\r involve an effective dimension instead of the
  global\r dimension, improving over existing results.  We show\r the importance of
  taking advantage of non-isotropic\r properties in learning problems with the following\r
  applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art results\r in statistical preconditioning
  for\r communication-efficient distributed optimization,\r ii) we introduce a non-isotropic
  randomized\r smoothing for non-smooth optimization. Both\r applications cover a
  class of functions that\r encompasses empirical risk minization (ERM) for\r linear
  models."
