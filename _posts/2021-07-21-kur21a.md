title: On the Minimal Error of Empirical Risk Minimization
abstract: "We study the minimal squared error of the Empirical\r Risk Minimization
  (ERM) procedure in the task of\r regression, both in random and fixed design\r settings.
  Our sharp lower bounds shed light on the\r possibility (or impossibility) of adapting
  to\r simplicity of the model generating the data. In the\r fixed design setting,
  we show that the error is\r governed by the global complexity of the entire\r class.
  In contrast, in random design, ERM may only\r adapt to simpler models if the local
  neighborhoods\r around the regression function are nearly as complex\r as the class
  itself, a somewhat counter-intuitive\r conclusion. We provide sharp lower bounds
  for\r performance of ERM in Donsker and non-Donsker\r classes. We also discuss our
  results through the\r lens of recent studies on interpolation in\r overparameterized
  models."
