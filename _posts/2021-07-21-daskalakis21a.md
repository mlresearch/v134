title: A Statistical Taylor Theorem and Extrapolation of Truncated Densities
abstract: 'We show a statistical version of Taylorâ€™s theorem and apply this result
  to non-parametric density estimation from truncated samples, which is a classical
  challenge in Statistics [Woodroofe 1985, Stute 1993]. The single-dimensional version
  of our theorem has the following implication: "For any distribution P on [0, 1]
  with a smooth log-density function, given samples from the conditional distribution
  of P on [a, a + \varepsilon] \subset [0, 1], we can efficiently identify an approximation
  to P over the whole interval [0, 1], with quality of approximation that improves
  with the smoothness of P".  To the best of knowledge, our result is the first in
  the area of non-parametric density estimation from truncated samples, which works
  under the hard truncation model, where the samples outside some survival set S are
  never observed, and applies to multiple dimensions. In contrast, previous works
  assume single dimensional data where each sample has a different survival set $S$
  so that samples from the whole support will ultimately be collected.'
