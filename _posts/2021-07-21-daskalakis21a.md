title: "A Statistical Taylor Theorem and Extrapolation of\r Truncated Densities"
abstract: "We show a statistical version of Taylorâ€™s theorem\r and apply this result
  to non-parametric density\r estimation from truncated samples, which is a\r classical
  challenge in Statistics [Woodroofe 1985,\r Stute 1993]. The single-dimensional version
  of our\r theorem has the following implication: \"For any\r distribution P on [0,
  1] with a smooth log-density\r function, given samples from the conditional\r distribution
  of P on [a, a + \\varepsilon] \\subset\r [0, 1], we can efficiently identify an
  approximation\r to P over the whole interval [0, 1], with quality of\r approximation
  that improves with the smoothness of\r P\".  To the best of knowledge, our result
  is the\r first in the area of non-parametric density\r estimation from truncated
  samples, which works under\r the hard truncation model, where the samples outside\r
  some survival set S are never observed, and applies\r to multiple dimensions. In
  contrast, previous works\r assume single dimensional data where each sample has\r
  a different survival set $S$ so that samples from\r the whole support will ultimately
  be collected."
