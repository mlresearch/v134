title: 'Group testing and local search: is there a computational-statistical gap?'
abstract: 'Group testing is a fundamental problem in statistical inference with many
  real-world applications, including the need for massive group testing during the
  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the task of approximate recovery,
  in which we tolerate having a small number of incorrectly classified items.  One
  of the most well-known, optimal, and easy to implement testing procedures is the
  non-adaptive Bernoulli group testing, where all tests are conducted in parallel,
  and each item is chosen to be part of any certain test independently with some fixed
  probability. In this setting, there is an observed gap between the number of tests
  above which recovery is information theoretically possible, and the number of tests
  required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to succeed. In this paper
  we seek to understand whether this computational-statistical gap can be closed.
  Our main contributions are the following: 1.Often times such gaps are explained
  by a phase transition in the landscape of the solution space of the problem (an
  Overlap Gap Property (OGP) phase transition). We provide first moment evidence that,
  perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition does not take place throughout the
  regime for which recovery is information theoretically possible. This fact suggests
  that the model is in fact amenable to local search algorithms.  2. We prove the
  complete absence of “bad” local minima for a part of the “hard” regime, a fact which
  implies an improvement over known theoretical results on the performance of efficient
  algorithms for approximate recovery without false-negatives.  3. Finally, motivated
  by the evidence for the abscence for the OGP, we present extensive simulations that
  strongly suggest that a very simple local algorithm known as Glauber Dynamics does
  indeed succeed, and can be used to efficiently implement the well-known (theoretically
  optimal) Smallest Satisfying Set (SSS) estimator. Given that practical algorithms
  for this task utilize Branch and Bound and Linear Programming relaxation techniques,
  our finding could potentially be of practical interest.'
