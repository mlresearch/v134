title: "Group testing and local search: is there a\r computational-statistical gap?"
abstract: "Group testing is a fundamental problem in\r statistical inference with
  many real-world\r applications, including the need for massive group\r testing during
  the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In\r this paper we study the task of approximate\r
  recovery, in which we tolerate having a small number\r of incorrectly classified
  items.  One of the most\r well-known, optimal, and easy to implement testing\r procedures
  is the non-adaptive Bernoulli group\r testing, where all tests are conducted in
  parallel,\r and each item is chosen to be part of any certain\r test independently
  with some fixed probability. In\r this setting, there is an observed gap between
  the\r number of tests above which recovery is information\r theoretically possible,
  and the number of tests\r required by the currently best known efficient\r algorithms
  to succeed. In this paper we seek to\r understand whether this computational-statistical\r
  gap can be closed. Our main contributions are the\r following: 1.Often times such
  gaps are explained by\r a phase transition in the landscape of the solution\r space
  of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property (OGP)\r phase transition). We provide first
  moment evidence\r that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition\r does not
  take place throughout the regime for which\r recovery is information theoretically
  possible. This\r fact suggests that the model is in fact amenable to\r local search
  algorithms.  2. We prove the complete\r absence of “bad” local minima for a part
  of the\r “hard” regime, a fact which implies an improvement\r over known theoretical
  results on the performance of\r efficient algorithms for approximate recovery\r
  without false-negatives.  3. Finally, motivated by\r the evidence for the abscence
  for the OGP, we\r present extensive simulations that strongly suggest\r that a very
  simple local algorithm known as Glauber\r Dynamics does indeed succeed, and can
  be used to\r efficiently implement the well-known (theoretically\r optimal) Smallest
  Satisfying Set (SSS)\r estimator. Given that practical algorithms for this\r task
  utilize Branch and Bound and Linear Programming\r relaxation techniques, our finding
  could potentially\r be of practical interest."
