title: "Instance-Dependent Complexity of Contextual Bandits\r and Reinforcement Learning:
  A Disagreement-Based\r Perspective"
abstract: "In the classical multi-armed bandit problem,\r instance-dependent algorithms
  attain improved\r performance on \"easy\" problems with a gap between\r the best
  and second-best arm. Are similar guarantees\r possible for contextual bandits? While
  positive\r results are known for certain special cases, there\r is no general theory
  characterizing when and how\r instance-dependent regret bounds for contextual\r
  bandits can be achieved for rich, general classes of\r policies. We introduce a
  family of complexity\r measures that are both sufficient and necessary to\r obtain
  instance-dependent regret bounds. We then\r introduce new oracle-efficient algorithms
  which\r adapt to the gap whenever possible, while also\r attaining the minimax rate
  in the worst\r case. Finally, we provide structural results that\r tie together
  a number of complexity measures\r previously proposed throughout contextual bandits,\r
  reinforcement learning, and active learning and\r elucidate their role in determining
  the optimal\r instance-dependent regret. In a large-scale\r empirical evaluation,
  we find that our approach\r often gives superior results for challenging\r exploration
  problems.  Turning our focus to\r reinforcement learning with function approximation,\r
  we develop new oracle-efficient algorithms for\r reinforcement learning with rich
  observations that\r obtain optimal gap-dependent sample complexity."
