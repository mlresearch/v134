title: 'Instance-Dependent Complexity of Contextual Bandits and Reinforcement Learning:
  A Disagreement-Based Perspective'
abstract: In the classical multi-armed bandit problem, instance-dependent algorithms
  attain improved performance on "easy" problems with a gap between the best and second-best
  arm. Are similar guarantees possible for contextual bandits? While positive results
  are known for certain special cases, there is no general theory characterizing when
  and how instance-dependent regret bounds for contextual bandits can be achieved
  for rich, general classes of policies. We introduce a family of complexity measures
  that are both sufficient and necessary to obtain instance-dependent regret bounds.
  We then introduce new oracle-efficient algorithms which adapt to the gap whenever
  possible, while also attaining the minimax rate in the worst case. Finally, we provide
  structural results that tie together a number of complexity measures previously
  proposed throughout contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, and active learning
  and elucidate their role in determining the optimal instance-dependent regret. In
  a large-scale empirical evaluation, we find that our approach often gives superior
  results for challenging exploration problems.  Turning our focus to reinforcement
  learning with function approximation, we develop new oracle-efficient algorithms
  for reinforcement learning with rich observations that obtain optimal gap-dependent
  sample complexity.
