title: "Breaking The Dimension Dependence in Sparse\r Distribution Estimation under
  Communication\r Constraints"
abstract: "We consider the problem of estimating a\r $d$-dimensional $s$-sparse discrete
  distribution\r from its samples observed under a $b$-bit\r communication constraint.
  The best-known previous\r result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for this problem\r
  is $O\\lp \\frac{s\\log\\lp\r {d}/{s}\\rp}{n2^b}\\rp$. Surprisingly, we show that\r
  when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold\r $n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve
  an $\\ell_2$\r estimation error of $O\\lp \\frac{s}{n2^b}\\rp$. This\r implies that
  when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence\r rate does not depend on the ambient dimension
  $d$\r and is the same as knowing the support of the\r distribution beforehand.  We
  next ask the question:\r “what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows\r dimension-free
  convergence?”.  To upper bound\r $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel localization\r
  schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the\r unknown support. For the non-interactive
  setting, we\r show that $n^*(s, d, b) = O\\lp \\min \\lp {d^2\\log^2\r d}/{2^b},
  {s^4\\log^2 d}/{2^b}\\rp \\rp$. Moreover, we\r connect the problem with non-adaptive
  group testing\r and obtain a polynomial-time estimation scheme when\r $n = \\tilde{\\Omega}\\lp{s^4\\log^4
  d}/{2^b}\\rp$. This\r group testing based scheme is adaptive to the\r sparsity parameter
  $s$, and hence can be applied\r without knowing it. For the interactive setting,
  we\r propose a novel tree-based estimation scheme and\r show that the minimum sample-size
  needed to achieve\r dimension-free convergence can be further reduced to\r $n^*(s,
  d, b) = \\tilde{O}\\lp {s^2\\log^2 d}/{2^b}\r \\rp$."
