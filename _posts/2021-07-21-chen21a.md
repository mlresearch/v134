title: Breaking The Dimension Dependence in Sparse Distribution Estimation under Communication
  Constraints
abstract: 'We consider the problem of estimating a $d$-dimensional $s$-sparse discrete
  distribution from its samples observed under a $b$-bit communication constraint.
  The best-known previous result on $\ell_2$ estimation error for this problem is
  $O\lp \frac{s\log\lp {d}/{s}\rp}{n2^b}\rp$. Surprisingly, we show that when sample
  size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold $n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\ell_2$
  estimation error of $O\lp \frac{s}{n2^b}\rp$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d,
  b)$ the convergence rate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the
  same as knowing the support of the distribution beforehand.  We next ask the question:
  “what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows dimension-free convergence?”.  To
  upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel localization schemes to accurately
  and efficiently localize the unknown support. For the non-interactive setting, we
  show that $n^*(s, d, b) = O\lp \min \lp {d^2\log^2 d}/{2^b}, {s^4\log^2 d}/{2^b}\rp
  \rp$. Moreover, we connect the problem with non-adaptive group testing and obtain
  a polynomial-time estimation scheme when $n = \tilde{\Omega}\lp{s^4\log^4 d}/{2^b}\rp$.
  This group testing based scheme is adaptive to the sparsity parameter $s$, and hence
  can be applied without knowing it. For the interactive setting, we propose a novel
  tree-based estimation scheme and show that the minimum sample-size needed to achieve
  dimension-free convergence can be further reduced to $n^*(s, d, b) = \tilde{O}\lp
  {s^2\log^2 d}/{2^b} \rp$.'
