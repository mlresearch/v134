title: Query complexity of least absolute deviation regression via robust uniform
  convergence
abstract: Consider a regression problem where the learner is given a large collection
  of $d$-dimensional data points, but can only query a small subset of the real-valued
  labels. How many queries are needed to obtain a $1+\epsilon$ relative error approximation
  of the optimum? While this problem has been extensively studied for least squares
  regression, little is known for other losses. An important example is least absolute
  deviation regression ($\ell_1$ regression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers
  compared to least squares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling
  methods in regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity
  of least absolute deviation regression is $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ up to logarithmic
  factors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query
  complexity for any $\ell_p$ loss with $p\in(1,2)$. As a key novelty in our analysis,
  we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new approximation
  guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform convergence in
  statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a correction term to
  avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This can be viewed as a new connection
  between statistical learning theory and variance reduction techniques in stochastic
  optimization, which should be of independent interest.
