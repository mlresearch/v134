title: "Query complexity of least absolute deviation\r regression via robust uniform
  convergence"
abstract: "Consider a regression problem where the learner is\r given a large collection
  of $d$-dimensional data\r points, but can only query a small subset of the\r real-valued
  labels. How many queries are needed to\r obtain a $1+\\epsilon$ relative error approximation\r
  of the optimum? While this problem has been\r extensively studied for least squares
  regression,\r little is known for other losses. An important\r example is least
  absolute deviation regression\r ($\\ell_1$ regression) which enjoys superior\r robustness
  to outliers compared to least squares. We\r develop a new framework for analyzing
  importance\r sampling methods in regression problems, which\r enables us to show
  that the query complexity of\r least absolute deviation regression is\r $\\Theta(d/\\epsilon^2)$
  up to logarithmic factors. We\r further extend our techniques to show the first\r
  bounds on the query complexity for any $\\ell_p$ loss\r with $p\\in(1,2)$. As a
  key novelty in our analysis,\r we introduce the notion of robust uniform\r convergence,
  which is a new approximation guarantee\r for the empirical loss. While it is inspired
  by\r uniform convergence in statistical learning, our\r approach additionally incorporates
  a correction term\r to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This\r can be
  viewed as a new connection between\r statistical learning theory and variance reduction\r
  techniques in stochastic optimization, which should\r be of independent interest."
