title: "Online Markov Decision Processes with Aggregate\r Bandit Feedback"
abstract: "We study a novel variant of online finite-horizon\r Markov Decision Processes
  with adversarially\r changing loss functions and initially unknown\r dynamics.  In
  each episode, the learner suffers the\r loss accumulated along the trajectory realized
  by\r the policy chosen for the episode, and observes\r aggregate bandit feedback:
  the trajectory is\r revealed along with the cumulative loss suffered,\r rather than
  the individual losses encountered along\r the trajectory.  Our main result is a\r
  computationally efficient algorithm with O(\\sqrt{K})\r regret for this setting,
  where K is the number of\r episodes.  We establish this result via an efficient\r
  reduction to a novel bandit learning setting we call\r Distorted Linear Bandits
  (DLB), which is a variant\r of bandit linear optimization where actions chosen\r
  by the learner are adversarially distorted before\r they are committed.  We then
  develop a\r computationally-efficient online algorithm for DLB\r for which we prove
  an O(\\sqrt{T}) regret bound,\r where T is the number of time steps.  Our algorithm\r
  is based on online mirror descent with a\r self-concordant barrier regularization
  that employs\r a novel increasing learning rate schedule."
