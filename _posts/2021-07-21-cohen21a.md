title: Online Markov Decision Processes with Aggregate Bandit Feedback
abstract: 'We study a novel variant of online finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes
  with adversarially changing loss functions and initially unknown dynamics.  In each
  episode, the learner suffers the loss accumulated along the trajectory realized
  by the policy chosen for the episode, and observes aggregate bandit feedback: the
  trajectory is revealed along with the cumulative loss suffered, rather than the
  individual losses encountered along the trajectory.  Our main result is a computationally
  efficient algorithm with $O(\sqrt{K})$ regret for this setting, where K is the number
  of episodes.  We establish this result via an efficient reduction to a novel bandit
  learning setting we call Distorted Linear Bandits (DLB), which is a variant of bandit
  linear optimization where actions chosen by the learner are adversarially distorted
  before they are committed.  We then develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm
  for DLB for which we prove an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, where T is the number of
  time steps.  Our algorithm is based on online mirror descent with a self-concordant
  barrier regularization that employs a novel increasing learning rate schedule.'
