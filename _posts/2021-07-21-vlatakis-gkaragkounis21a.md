title: Reconstructing weighted voting schemes from partial information about their
  power indices
abstract: A number of recent works [Goldberg 2006; O’Donnell and Servedio 2011; De,
  Diakonikolas, and Servedio 2017; De, Diakonikolas, Feldman, and Servedio 2014] have
  considered the problem of approximately reconstructing an unknown weighted voting
  scheme given information about various sorts of “power indices” that characterize
  the level of control that individual voters have over the final outcome. In the
  language of theoretical computer science, this is the problem of approximating an
  unknown linear threshold function (LTF) over ${-1,1}^n$ given some numerical measure
  (such as the function’s n “Chow parameters,” a.k.a. its degree-1 Fourier coefficients,
  or the vector of its n Shapley indices) of how much each of the n individual input
  variables affects the outcome of the function. In this paper we consider the problem
  of reconstructing an LTF given only partial information about its Chow parameters
  or Shapley indices; i.e. we are given only the Chow parameters or the Shapley indices
  corresponding to a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ of the n input variables. A natural goal
  in this partial information setting is to find an LTF whose Chow parameters or Shapley
  indices corresponding to indices in S accurately match the given Chow parameters
  or Shapley indices of the unknown LTF. We refer to this as the Partial Inverse Power
  Index Problem. Our main results are a polynomial time algorithm for the ($\epsilon$-approximate)
  Chow Parameters Partial Inverse Power Index Problem and a quasi-polynomial time
  algorithm for the ($\epsilon$-approximate) Shapley Indices Partial Inverse Power
  Index Problem.
