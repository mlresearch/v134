title: "Reconstructing weighted voting schemes from partial\r information about their
  power indices"
abstract: "A number of recent works [Goldberg 2006; O’Donnell\r and Servedio 2011;
  De, Diakonikolas, and Servedio\r 2017; De, Diakonikolas, Feldman, and Servedio 2014]\r
  have considered the problem of approximately\r reconstructing an unknown weighted
  voting scheme\r given information about various sorts of “power\r indices” that
  characterize the level of control\r that individual voters have over the final\r
  outcome. In the language of theoretical computer\r science, this is the problem
  of approximating an\r unknown linear threshold function (LTF) over\r ${-1,1}^n$
  given some numerical measure (such as the\r function’s n “Chow parameters,” a.k.a.
  its\r degree-1 Fourier coefficients, or the vector of its\r n Shapley indices) of
  how much each of the n\r individual input variables affects the outcome of\r the
  function. In this paper we consider the problem\r of reconstructing an LTF given
  only partial\r information about its Chow parameters or Shapley\r indices; i.e.
  we are given only the Chow parameters\r or the Shapley indices corresponding to
  a subset\r $S\\subseteq [n]$ of the n input variables. A natural\r goal in this
  partial information setting is to find\r an LTF whose Chow parameters or Shapley
  indices\r corresponding to indices in S accurately match the\r given Chow parameters
  or Shapley indices of the\r unknown LTF. We refer to this as the Partial Inverse\r
  Power Index Problem. Our main results are a\r polynomial time algorithm for the\r
  ($\\epsilon$-approximate) Chow Parameters Partial\r Inverse Power Index Problem
  and a quasi-polynomial\r time algorithm for the ($\\epsilon$-approximate)\r Shapley
  Indices Partial Inverse Power Index\r Problem."
