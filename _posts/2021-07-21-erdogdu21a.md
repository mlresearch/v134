title: 'On the Convergence of Langevin Monte Carlo: The Interplay between Tail Growth
  and Smoothness'
abstract: We study sampling from a target distribution $\nu_* = e^{-f}$ using the
  unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm.  For any potential function $f$
  whose tails behave like $\|x\|^\alpha$ for ${\alpha \in [1,2]}$, and has $\beta$-HÃ¶lder
  continuous gradient, we prove that $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big(d^{\frac{1}{\beta}+\frac{1+\beta}{\beta}(\frac{2}{\alpha}-{1}_{\{\alpha
  \neq 1\}})} \epsilon^{-\frac{1}{\beta}}\Big)$ steps are sufficient to reach the
  $\epsilon$-neighborhood of a $d$-dimensional target distribution $\nu_*$ in KL-divergence.  This
  bound, in terms of $\epsilon$ dependency, is not directly influenced by the tail
  growth rate $\alpha$ of the potential function as long as its growth is at least
  linear, and it only relies on the order of smoothness $\beta$.  One notable consequence
  of this result is that for potentials with Lipschitz gradient, i.e. $\beta=1$, the
  above rate recovers the best known rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (d\epsilon^{-1})$
  which was established for strongly convex potentials in terms of $\epsilon$ dependency,
  but we show that the same rate is achievable for a wider class of potentials that
  are degenerately convex at infinity.  The growth rate $\alpha$ affects the rate
  estimate in high dimensions where $d$ is large; furthermore, it recovers the best-known
  dimension dependency when the tail growth of the potential is quadratic, i.e. $\alpha
  = 2$, in the current setup.
