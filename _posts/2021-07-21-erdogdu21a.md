title: "On the Convergence of Langevin Monte Carlo: The\r Interplay between Tail Growth
  and Smoothness"
abstract: "We study sampling from a target distribution $\\nu_*\r = e^{-f}$ using
  the unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo\r (LMC) algorithm.  For any potential function
  $f$\r whose tails behave like $\\|x\\|^\\alpha$ for ${\\alpha\r \\in [1,2]}$, and
  has $\\beta$-HÃ¶lder continuous\r gradient, we prove that $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\r
  \\Big(d^{\\frac{1}{\\beta}+\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}(\\frac{2}{\\alpha}-{1}_{\\{\\alpha\r
  \\neq 1\\}})} \\epsilon^{-\\frac{1}{\\beta}}\\Big)$ steps\r are sufficient to reach
  the $\\epsilon$-neighborhood\r of a $d$-dimensional target distribution $\\nu_*$
  in\r KL-divergence.  This bound, in terms of $\\epsilon$\r dependency, is not directly
  influenced by the tail\r growth rate $\\alpha$ of the potential function as\r long
  as its growth is at least linear, and it only\r relies on the order of smoothness
  $\\beta$.  One\r notable consequence of this result is that for\r potentials with
  Lipschitz gradient, i.e. $\\beta=1$,\r the above rate recovers the best known rate\r
  $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (d\\epsilon^{-1})$ which was\r established for strongly
  convex potentials in terms\r of $\\epsilon$ dependency, but we show that the same\r
  rate is achievable for a wider class of potentials\r that are degenerately convex
  at infinity.  The\r growth rate $\\alpha$ affects the rate estimate in\r high dimensions
  where $d$ is large; furthermore, it\r recovers the best-known dimension dependency
  when\r the tail growth of the potential is quadratic, i.e.\r $\\alpha = 2$, in the
  current setup."
