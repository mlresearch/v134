title: "The Min-Max Complexity of Distributed Stochastic\r Convex Optimization with
  Intermittent Communication"
abstract: "We resolve the min-max complexity of distributed\r stochastic convex optimization
  (up to a log factor)\r in the intermittent communication setting, where $M$\r machines
  work in parallel over the course of $R$\r rounds of communication to optimize the
  objective,\r and during each round of communication, each machine\r may sequentially
  compute $K$ stochastic gradient\r estimates. We present a novel lower bound with
  a\r matching upper bound that establishes an optimal\r algorithm."
