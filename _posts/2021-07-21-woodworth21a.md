title: The Min-Max Complexity of Distributed Stochastic Convex Optimization with Intermittent
  Communication
abstract: We resolve the min-max complexity of distributed stochastic convex optimization
  (up to a log factor) in the intermittent communication setting, where $M$ machines
  work in parallel over the course of $R$ rounds of communication to optimize the
  objective, and during each round of communication, each machine may sequentially
  compute $K$ stochastic gradient estimates. We present a novel lower bound with a
  matching upper bound that establishes an optimal algorithm.
