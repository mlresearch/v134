title: "Majorizing Measures, Sequential Complexities, and\r Online Learning"
abstract: "We introduce the technique of generic chaining and\r majorizing measures
  for controlling sequential\r Rademacher complexity. We relate majorizing measures\r
  to the notion of fractional covering numbers, which\r we show to be dominated in
  terms of sequential\r scale-sensitive dimensions in a horizon-independent\r way,
  and, under additional complexity assumptions\r establish a tight control on worst-case
  sequential\r Rademacher complexity in terms of the integral of\r sequential scale-sensitive
  dimension. Finally, we\r establish a tight contraction inequality for\r worst-case
  sequential Rademacher complexity.  The\r above constitutes the resolution of a number
  of\r outstanding open problems in extending the classical\r theory of empirical
  processes to the sequential\r case, and, in turn, establishes sharp results for\r
  online learning."
