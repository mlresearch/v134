title: Majorizing Measures, Sequential Complexities, and Online Learning
abstract: We introduce the technique of generic chaining and majorizing measures for
  controlling sequential Rademacher complexity. We relate majorizing measures to the
  notion of fractional covering numbers, which we show to be dominated in terms of
  sequential scale-sensitive dimensions in a horizon-independent way, and, under additional
  complexity assumptions establish a tight control on worst-case sequential Rademacher
  complexity in terms of the integral of sequential scale-sensitive dimension. Finally,
  we establish a tight contraction inequality for worst-case sequential Rademacher
  complexity.  The above constitutes the resolution of a number of outstanding open
  problems in extending the classical theory of empirical processes to the sequential
  case, and, in turn, establishes sharp results for online learning.
