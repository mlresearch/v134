title: "Near Optimal Distributed Learning of Halfspaces with\r Two Parties"
abstract: "Distributed learning protocols are designed to train\r on distributed data
  without gathering it all on a\r single centralized machine, thus contributing to
  the\r efficiency of the system and enhancing its\r privacy. We study a central problem
  in distributed\r learning, called distributed learning of halfspaces:\r let $U \\subseteq
  \\R^d$ be a known domain of size $n$\r and let $h:\\R^d\\to \\R$ be an unknown target
  affine\r function. A set of examples $\\{(u,b)\\}$ is\r distributed between several
  parties, where $u \\in U$\r is a point and $b = \\sign(h(u)) \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$
  is\r its label. The parties’ goal is to agree on a\r classifier $f: U\\to\\{\\pm
  1\\}$ such that $f(u)=b$ for\r every input example $(u,b)$.  We design a protocol\r
  for the distributed halfspace learning problem in\r the two-party setting, communicating
  only $\\tilde\r O(d\\log n)$ bits. To this end, we introduce a new\r tool called
  halfspace containers, that is closely\r related to bracketing numbers in statistics
  and to\r hyperplane cuttings in discrete geometry, and allows\r for a compressed
  approximate representation of every\r halfspace. We complement our upper bound result
  by\r an almost matching $\\tilde \\Omega(d\\log n)$ lower\r bound on the communication
  complexity of any such\r protocol.  Since the distributed halfspace learning\r problem
  is closely related to the convex set\r disjointness problem in communication complexity
  and\r the problem of distributed linear programming in\r distributed optimization,
  we also derive upper and\r lower bounds of $\\tilde O(d^2\\log n)$\r and $\\tilde{\\Omega}(d\\log
  n)$ on the communication\r complexity of both of these basic problems."
