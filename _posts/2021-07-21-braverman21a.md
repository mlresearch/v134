title: Near Optimal Distributed Learning of Halfspaces with Two Parties
abstract: 'Distributed learning protocols are designed to train on distributed data
  without gathering it all on a single centralized machine, thus contributing to the
  efficiency of the system and enhancing its privacy. We study a central problem in
  distributed learning, called distributed learning of halfspaces: let $U \subseteq
  \R^d$ be a known domain of size $n$ and let $h:\R^d\to \R$ be an unknown target
  affine function. A set of examples $\{(u,b)\}$ is distributed between several parties,
  where $u \in U$ is a point and $b = \sign(h(u)) \in \{\pm 1\}$ is its label. The
  parties’ goal is to agree on a classifier $f: U\to\{\pm 1\}$ such that $f(u)=b$
  for every input example $(u,b)$.  We design a protocol for the distributed halfspace
  learning problem in the two-party setting, communicating only $\tilde O(d\log n)$
  bits. To this end, we introduce a new tool called halfspace containers, that is
  closely related to bracketing numbers in statistics and to hyperplane cuttings in
  discrete geometry, and allows for a compressed approximate representation of every
  halfspace. We complement our upper bound result by an almost matching $\tilde \Omega(d\log
  n)$ lower bound on the communication complexity of any such protocol.  Since the
  distributed halfspace learning problem is closely related to the convex set disjointness
  problem in communication complexity and the problem of distributed linear programming
  in distributed optimization, we also derive upper and lower bounds of $\tilde O(d^2\log
  n)$ and $\tilde{\Omega}(d\log n)$ on the communication complexity of both of these
  basic problems.'
