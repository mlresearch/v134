title: Agnostic Proper Learning of Halfspaces under Gaussian Marginals
abstract: We study the problem of agnostically learning halfspaces under the Gaussian
  distribution. Our main result is the {\em first proper} learning algorithm for this
  problem whose running time qualitatively matches that of the best known improper
  agnostic learner. Building on this result, we also obtain the first proper polynomial
  time approximation scheme (PTAS) for agnostically learning homogeneous halfspaces.
  Our techniques naturally extend to agnostically learning linear models with respect
  to other activation functions, yielding the first proper agnostic algorithm for
  ReLU regression.
