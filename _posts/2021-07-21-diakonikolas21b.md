title: "Agnostic Proper Learning of Halfspaces under\r Gaussian Marginals"
abstract: "We study the problem of agnostically learning\r halfspaces under the Gaussian
  distribution. Our main\r result is the {\\em first proper} learning algorithm\r
  for this problem whose running time qualitatively\r matches that of the best known
  improper agnostic\r learner. Building on this result, we also obtain the\r first
  proper polynomial time approximation scheme\r (PTAS) for agnostically learning homogeneous\r
  halfspaces. Our techniques naturally extend to\r agnostically learning linear models
  with respect to\r other activation functions, yielding the first\r proper agnostic
  algorithm for ReLU regression."
