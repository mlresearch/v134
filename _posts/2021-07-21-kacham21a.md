title: Reduced-Rank Regression with Operator Norm Error
abstract: "A common data analysis task is the reduced-rank\r regression problem: $$\\min_{\\textrm{rank-}k
  \ X}\r \\|AX-B\\|,$$ where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times c}$\r and $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n
  \\times d}$ are given large\r matrices and $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is some norm. Here the\r
  unknown matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times d}$ is\r constrained to be of rank
  $k$ as it results in a\r significant parameter reduction of the solution when\r
  $c$ and $d$ are large. In the case of Frobenius norm\r error, there is a standard
  closed form solution to\r this problem and a fast algorithm to find a\r $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate
  solution. However, for\r the important case of operator norm error, no closed\r
  form solution is known and the fastest known\r algorithms take singular value decomposition
  time.\r We give the first randomized algorithms for this\r problem running in time
  $$(nnz{(A)} + nnz{(B)} +\r c^2) \\cdot k/\\varepsilon^{1.5} + (n+d)k^2/\\epsilon
  +\r c^{\\omega},$$ up to a polylogarithmic factor\r involving condition numbers,
  matrix dimensions, and\r dependence on $1/\\varepsilon$. Here $nnz{(M)}$\r denotes
  the number of non-zero entries of a matrix\r $M$, and $\\omega$ is the exponent
  of matrix\r multiplication. As both (1) spectral low rank\r approximation ($A =
  B$) and (2) linear system\r solving ($n = c$ and $d = 1$) are special cases, our\r
  time cannot be improved by more than a\r $1/\\varepsilon$ factor (up to polylogarithmic\r
  factors) without a major breakthrough in linear\r algebra. Interestingly, known
  techniques for low\r rank approximation, such as alternating minimization\r or sketch-and-solve,
  provably fail for this\r problem. Instead, our algorithm uses an existential\r characterization
  of a solution, together with Krylov\r methods, low degree polynomial approximation,
  and\r sketching-based preconditioning."
