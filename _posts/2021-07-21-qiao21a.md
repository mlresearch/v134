title: Exponential Weights Algorithms for Selective Learning
abstract: We study the selective learning problem introduced by Qiao and Valiant (2019),
  in which the learner observes $n$ labeled data points one at a time. At a time of
  its choosing, the learner selects a window length $w$ and a model $\hat\ell$ from
  the model class $\mathcal{L}$, and then labels the next $w$ data points using $\hat\ell$.
  The \emph{excess risk} incurred by the learner is defined as the difference between
  the average loss of $\hat\ell$ over those $w$ data points and the smallest possible
  average loss among all models in $\mathcal{L}$ over those $w$ data points.  We give
  an improved algorithm, termed the \emph{hybrid exponential weights} algorithm, that
  achieves an expected excess risk of $O((\log\log|\mathcal{L}| + \log\log n)/\log
  n)$. This result gives a doubly exponential improvement in the dependence on $|\mathcal{L}|$
  over the best known bound of $O(\sqrt{|\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$. We complement the
  positive result with an almost matching lower bound, which suggests the worst-case
  optimality of the algorithm.  We also study a more restrictive family of learning
  algorithms that are \emph{bounded-recall} in the sense that when a prediction window
  of length $w$ is chosen, the learnerâ€™s decision only depends on the most recent
  $w$ data points. We analyze an exponential weights variant of the ERM algorithm
  in Qiao and Valiant (2019). This new algorithm achieves an expected excess risk
  of $O(\sqrt{\log |\mathcal{L}|/\log n})$, which is shown to be nearly optimal among
  all bounded-recall learners. Our analysis builds on a generalized version of the
  selective mean prediction problem in Drucker (2013); Qiao and Valiant (2019), which
  may be of independent interest.
