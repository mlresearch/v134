title: "Exponential Weights Algorithms for Selective\r Learning"
abstract: "We study the selective learning problem introduced\r by Qiao and Valiant
  (2019), in which the learner\r observes $n$ labeled data points one at a time. At
  a\r time of its choosing, the learner selects a window\r length $w$ and a model
  $\\hat\\ell$ from the model\r class $\\mathcal{L}$, and then labels the next $w$\r
  data points using $\\hat\\ell$. The \\emph{excess risk}\r incurred by the learner
  is defined as the difference\r between the average loss of $\\hat\\ell$ over those\r
  $w$ data points and the smallest possible average\r loss among all models in $\\mathcal{L}$
  over those\r $w$ data points.  We give an improved algorithm,\r termed the \\emph{hybrid
  exponential weights}\r algorithm, that achieves an expected excess risk of\r $O((\\log\\log|\\mathcal{L}|
  + \\log\\log n)/\\log\r n)$. This result gives a doubly exponential\r improvement
  in the dependence on $|\\mathcal{L}|$\r over the best known bound of\r $O(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{L}|/\\log
  n})$. We complement the\r positive result with an almost matching lower bound,\r
  which suggests the worst-case optimality of the\r algorithm.  We also study a more
  restrictive family\r of learning algorithms that are\r \\emph{bounded-recall} in
  the sense that when a\r prediction window of length $w$ is chosen, the\r learnerâ€™s
  decision only depends on the most recent\r $w$ data points. We analyze an exponential
  weights\r variant of the ERM algorithm in Qiao and Valiant\r (2019). This new algorithm
  achieves an expected\r excess risk of $O(\\sqrt{\\log |\\mathcal{L}|/\\log\r n})$,
  which is shown to be nearly optimal among all\r bounded-recall learners. Our analysis
  builds on a\r generalized version of the selective mean prediction\r problem in
  Drucker (2013); Qiao and Valiant (2019),\r which may be of independent interest."
