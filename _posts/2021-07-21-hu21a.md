title: Fast Rates for the Regret of Offline Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study the regret of reinforcement learning from offline data generated
  by a fixed behavior policy in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process
  (MDP). While existing analyses of common approaches, such as fitted $Q$-iteration
  (FQI), suggest a $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ convergence for regret, empirical behavior exhibits
  much faster convergence. In this paper, we present a finer regret analysis that
  exactly characterized this phenomenon by providing fast rates for the regret convergence.
  First, we show that given any estimate for the optimal quality function $Q^*$, the
  regret of the policy it defines converges at a rate given by the exponentiation
  of the $Q^*$-estimateâ€™s pointwise convergence rate, thus speeding it up. The level
  of exponentiation depends on the level of noise in the decision-making problem,
  rather than the estimation problem. We establish such noise levels for linear and
  tabular MDPs as examples. Second, we provide new analyses of FQI and Bellman residual
  minimization to establish the correct pointwise convergence guarantees. As specific
  cases, our results imply $O(1/n)$ regret rates in linear cases and $\exp(-\Omega(n))$
  regret rates in tabular cases.
