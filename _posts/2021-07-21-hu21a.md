title: "Fast Rates for the Regret of Offline Reinforcement\r Learning"
abstract: "We study the regret of reinforcement learning from\r offline data generated
  by a fixed behavior policy in\r an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision\r
  process (MDP). While existing analyses of common\r approaches, such as fitted $Q$-iteration
  (FQI),\r suggest a $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ convergence for regret,\r empirical behavior
  exhibits much faster\r convergence. In this paper, we present a finer\r regret analysis
  that exactly characterized this\r phenomenon by providing fast rates for the regret\r
  convergence. First, we show that given any estimate\r for the optimal quality function
  $Q^*$, the regret\r of the policy it defines converges at a rate given\r by the
  exponentiation of the $Q^*$-estimateâ€™s\r pointwise convergence rate, thus speeding
  it up. The\r level of exponentiation depends on the level of\r noise in the decision-making
  problem, rather than\r the estimation problem. We establish such noise\r levels
  for linear and tabular MDPs as\r examples. Second, we provide new analyses of FQI
  and\r Bellman residual minimization to establish the\r correct pointwise convergence
  guarantees. As\r specific cases, our results imply $O(1/n)$ regret\r rates in linear
  cases and $\\exp(-\\Omega(n))$ regret\r rates in tabular cases."
