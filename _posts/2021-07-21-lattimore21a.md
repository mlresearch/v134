title: "Improved Regret for Zeroth-Order Stochastic Convex\r Bandits"
abstract: "We present an efficient algorithm for stochastic\r bandit convex optimisation
  with no assumptions on\r smoothness or strong convexity and for which the\r regret
  is bounded by O(d^(4.5) sqrt(n) polylog(n)),\r where n is the number of interactions
  and d is the\r dimension."
