title: Improved Regret for Zeroth-Order Stochastic Convex Bandits
abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for stochastic bandit convex optimisation
  with no assumptions on smoothness or strong convexity and for which the regret is
  bounded by O(d^(4.5) sqrt(n) polylog(n)), where n is the number of interactions
  and d is the dimension.
