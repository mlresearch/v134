title: Online Learning from Optimal Actions
abstract: "We study the problem of online contextual\r optimization where, at each
  period, instead of\r observing the loss, we observe, after-the-fact, the\r optimal
  action an oracle with full knowledge of the\r objective function would have taken.
  At each period,\r the decision-maker has access to a new set of\r feasible actions
  to select from and to a new\r contextual function that affects that periodâ€™s loss\r
  function. We aim to minimize regret, which is\r defined as the difference between
  our losses and the\r ones incurred by an all-knowing oracle. We obtain\r the first
  regret bound for this problem that is\r logarithmic in the time horizon. Our results
  are\r derived through the development and analysis of a\r novel algorithmic structure
  that leverages the\r underlying geometry of the problem."
