title: Black-Box Control for Linear Dynamical Systems
abstract: "We consider the problem of black-box control: the\r task of controlling
  an unknown linear time-invariant\r dynamical system from a single trajectory without
  a\r stabilizing controller. Under the assumption that\r the system is controllable,
  we give the first {\\it\r efficient} algorithm that is capable of attaining\r sublinear
  regret under the setting of online\r nonstochastic control. This resolves an open
  problem\r since the work of Abbasi-Yadkori and\r Szepesvari(2011) on the stochastic
  LQR problem, and\r in a more challenging setting that allows for\r adversarial perturbations
  and adversarially chosen\r changing convex loss functions. We give finite-time\r
  regret bounds for our algorithm on the order of\r $2^{poly(d)} + \\tilde{O}(poly(d)
  T^{2/3})$ for\r general nonstochastic control, and $2^{poly(d)} +\r \\tilde{O}(poly(d)
  \\sqrt{T})$ for black-box LQR. To\r complete the picture, we investigate the complexity\r
  of the online black-box control problem and give a\r matching regret lower bound
  of $2^{\\Omega(d)}$,\r showing that the exponential cost is\r inevitable. This lower
  bound holds even in the\r noiseless setting, and applies to any, randomized or\r
  deterministic, black-box control method."
