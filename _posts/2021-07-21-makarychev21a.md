title: "Approximation Algorithms for Socially Fair\r Clustering"
abstract: "We present an (e^{O(p)} (log \\ell) / (log log\r \\ell))-approximation
  algorithm for socially fair\r clustering with the l_p-objective. In this problem,\r
  we are given a set of points in a metric space. Each\r point belongs to one (or
  several) of \\ell groups.\r The goal is to find a k-medians, k-means, or, more\r
  generally, l_p-clustering that is simultaneously\r good for all of the groups. More
  precisely, we need\r to find a set of k centers C so as to minimize the\r maximum
  over all groups j of \\sum_{u in group j}\r d(u, C)^p.  The socially fair clustering
  problem was\r independently proposed by Abbasi, Bhaskara, and\r Venkatasubramanian
  (2021) and Ghadiri, Samadi, and\r Vempala (2021). Our algorithm improves and\r generalizes
  their O(\\ell)-approximation algorithms\r for the problem.  The natural LP relaxation
  for the\r problem has an integrality gap of \\Omega(\\ell). In\r order to obtain
  our result, we introduce a\r strengthened LP relaxation and show that it has an\r
  integrality gap of \\Theta((log \\ell) / (log log\r \\ell)) for a fixed p. Additionally,
  we present a\r bicriteria approximation algorithm, which\r generalizes the bicriteria
  approximation of Abbasi\r et al. (2021)."
