title: "Towards a Query-Optimal and Time-Efficient Algorithm\r for Clustering with
  a Faulty Oracle"
abstract: "Motivated by applications in crowdsourced entity\r resolution in database,
  signed edge prediction in\r social networks and correlation clustering, Mazumdar\r
  and Saha [NIPS 2017] proposed an elegant theoretical\r model for studying clustering
  with a faulty\r oracle. In this model, given a set of $n$ items\r which belong to
  $k$ unknown groups (or clusters),\r our goal is to recover the clusters by asking\r
  pairwise queries to an oracle. This oracle can\r answer the query that “do items
  $u$ and $v$ belong\r to the same cluster?”. However, the answer to each\r pairwise
  query errs with probability $\\epsilon$, for\r some $\\epsilon\\in(0,\\frac12)$.
  Mazumdar and Saha\r provided two algorithms under this model: one\r algorithm is
  query-optimal while time-inefficient\r (i.e., running in quasi-polynomial time),
  the other\r is time efficient (i.e., in polynomial time) while\r query-suboptimal.
  Larsen, Mitzenmacher and\r Tsourakakis [WWW 2020] then gave a new\r time-efficient
  algorithm for the special case of $2$\r clusters, which is query-optimal if the
  bias\r $\\delta:=1-2\\epsilon$ of the model is large. It was\r left as an open question
  whether one can obtain a\r query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the\r general
  case of $k$ clusters and other regimes of\r $\\delta$.  In this paper, we make progress
  on the\r above question and provide a time-efficient\r algorithm with nearly-optimal
  query complexity (up\r to a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$\r and
  any $\\delta$ in the regime when\r information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our\r
  algorithm is built on a connection to the stochastic\r block model."
