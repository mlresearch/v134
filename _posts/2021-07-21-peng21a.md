title: Towards a Query-Optimal and Time-Efficient Algorithm for Clustering with a
  Faulty Oracle
abstract: 'Motivated by applications in crowdsourced entity resolution in database,
  signed edge prediction in social networks and correlation clustering, Mazumdar and
  Saha [NIPS 2017] proposed an elegant theoretical model for studying clustering with
  a faulty oracle. In this model, given a set of $n$ items which belong to $k$ unknown
  groups (or clusters), our goal is to recover the clusters by asking pairwise queries
  to an oracle. This oracle can answer the query that “do items $u$ and $v$ belong
  to the same cluster?”. However, the answer to each pairwise query errs with probability
  $\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$. Mazumdar and Saha provided two algorithms
  under this model: one algorithm is query-optimal while time-inefficient (i.e., running
  in quasi-polynomial time), the other is time efficient (i.e., in polynomial time)
  while query-suboptimal. Larsen, Mitzenmacher and Tsourakakis [WWW 2020] then gave
  a new time-efficient algorithm for the special case of $2$ clusters, which is query-optimal
  if the bias $\delta:=1-2\epsilon$ of the model is large. It was left as an open
  question whether one can obtain a query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the
  general case of $k$ clusters and other regimes of $\delta$.  In this paper, we make
  progress on the above question and provide a time-efficient algorithm with nearly-optimal
  query complexity (up to a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$ and any
  $\delta$ in the regime when information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our algorithm
  is built on a connection to the stochastic block model.'
