title: Minimax Regret for Stochastic Shortest Path with Adversarial Costs and Known
  Transition
abstract: We study the stochastic shortest path problem with adversarial costs and
  known transition, and show that the minimax regret is $O(\sqrt{DT_\star K})$ and
  $O(\sqrt{DT_\star SA K})$ for the full-information setting and the bandit feedback
  setting respectively, where $D$ is the diameter, $T_\star$ is the expected hitting
  time of the optimal policy, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
  and $K$ is the number of episodes. Our results significantly improve upon the recent
  work of (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2020) which only considers the full-information
  setting and achieves suboptimal regret. Our work is also the first to consider bandit
  feedback with adversarial costs.  Our algorithms are built on top of the Online
  Mirror Descent framework with a variety of new techniques that might be of independent
  interest, including an improved multi-scale expert algorithm, a reduction from general
  stochastic shortest path to a special loop-free case, a skewed occupancy measure
  space, and a novel correction term added to the cost estimators. Interestingly,
  the last two elements reduce the variance of the learner via positive bias and the
  variance of the optimal policy via negative bias respectively, and having them simultaneously
  is critical for obtaining the optimal high-probability bound in the bandit feedback
  setting.
