title: "Minimax Regret for Stochastic Shortest Path with\r Adversarial Costs and Known
  Transition"
abstract: "We study the stochastic shortest path problem with\r adversarial costs
  and known transition, and show\r that the minimax regret is $O(\\sqrt{DT_\\star
  K})$\r and $O(\\sqrt{DT_\\star SA K})$ for the\r full-information setting and the
  bandit feedback\r setting respectively, where $D$ is the diameter,\r $T_\\star$
  is the expected hitting time of the\r optimal policy, $S$ is the number of states,
  $A$ is\r the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of\r episodes. Our results
  significantly improve upon the\r recent work of (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2020) which\r
  only considers the full-information setting and\r achieves suboptimal regret. Our
  work is also the\r first to consider bandit feedback with adversarial\r costs.  Our
  algorithms are built on top of the\r Online Mirror Descent framework with a variety
  of\r new techniques that might be of independent\r interest, including an improved
  multi-scale expert\r algorithm, a reduction from general stochastic\r shortest path
  to a special loop-free case, a skewed\r occupancy measure space, and a novel correction
  term\r added to the cost estimators. Interestingly, the\r last two elements reduce
  the variance of the learner\r via positive bias and the variance of the optimal\r
  policy via negative bias respectively, and having\r them simultaneously is critical
  for obtaining the\r optimal high-probability bound in the bandit\r feedback setting."
