title: "A Dimension-free Computational Upper-bound for\r Smooth Optimal Transport
  Estimation"
abstract: "It is well-known that plug-in statistical estimation\r of optimal transport
  suffers from the curse of\r dimensionality. Despite recent efforts to improve\r
  the rate of estimation with the smoothness of the\r problem, the computational complexity
  of these\r recently proposed methods still degrade\r exponentially with the dimension.
  In this paper,\r thanks to an infinite-dimensional sum-of-squares\r representation,
  we derive a statistical estimator of\r smooth optimal transport which achieves a
  precision\r $\\varepsilon$ from $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$\r independent and
  identically distributed samples from\r the distributions, for a computational cost
  of\r $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ when the smoothness\r increases, hence yielding
  dimension-free statistical\r \\emph{and} computational rates, with potentially\r
  exponentially dimension-dependent constants."
