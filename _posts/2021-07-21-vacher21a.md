title: A Dimension-free Computational Upper-bound for Smooth Optimal Transport Estimation
abstract: It is well-known that plug-in statistical estimation of optimal transport
  suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Despite recent efforts to improve the
  rate of estimation with the smoothness of the problem, the computational complexity
  of these recently proposed methods still degrade exponentially with the dimension.
  In this paper, thanks to an infinite-dimensional sum-of-squares representation,
  we derive a statistical estimator of smooth optimal transport which achieves a precision
  $\varepsilon$ from $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ independent and identically distributed
  samples from the distributions, for a computational cost of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$
  when the smoothness increases, hence yielding dimension-free statistical \emph{and}
  computational rates, with potentially exponentially dimension-dependent constants.
