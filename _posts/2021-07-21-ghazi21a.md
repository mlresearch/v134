title: On Avoiding the Union Bound When Answering Multiple Differentially Private
  Queries
abstract: In this work, we study the problem of answering $k$ queries with $(\epsilon,
  \delta)$-differential privacy, where each query has sensitivity one. We give an
  algorithm for this task that achieves an expected $\ell_\infty$ error bound of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\sqrt{k
  \log \frac{1}{\delta}})$, which is known to be tight (Steinke and Ullman, 2016).  A
  very recent work by Dagan and Kur (2020) provides a similar result, albeit via a
  completely different approach. One difference between our work and theirs is that
  our guarantee holds even when $\delta < 2^{-\Omega(k/(\log k)^8)}$ whereas theirs
  does not apply in this case. On the other hand, the algorithm of Dagan and Kur (2020)
  has a remarkable advantage that the $\ell_{\infty}$ error bound of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\sqrt{k
  \log \frac{1}{\delta}})$ holds not only in expectation but always (i.e., with probability
  one) while we can only get a high probability (or expected) guarantee on the error.
