title: "On Avoiding the Union Bound When Answering Multiple\r Differentially Private
  Queries"
abstract: "In this work, we study the problem of answering $k$\r queries with $(\\epsilon,
  \\delta)$-differential\r privacy, where each query has sensitivity one. We\r give
  an algorithm for this task that achieves an\r expected $\\ell_\\infty$ error bound
  of\r $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{k \\log\r \\frac{1}{\\delta}})$, which is known
  to be tight\r (Steinke and Ullman, 2016).  A very recent work by\r Dagan and Kur
  (2020) provides a similar result,\r albeit via a completely different approach.
  One\r difference between our work and theirs is that our\r guarantee holds even
  when $\\delta <\r 2^{-\\Omega(k/(\\log k)^8)}$ whereas theirs does not\r apply in
  this case. On the other hand, the algorithm\r of Dagan and Kur (2020) has a remarkable
  advantage\r that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ error bound of\r $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{k
  \\log\r \\frac{1}{\\delta}})$ holds not only in expectation\r but always (i.e.,
  with probability one) while we can\r only get a high probability (or expected) guarantee\r
  on the error."
