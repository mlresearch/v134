title: Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation
abstract: "We show how to achieve the notion of\r \"multicalibration\" from Hebert-Johnson
  et al. (2018)\r not just for means, but also for variances and other\r higher moments.
  \ Informally, this means that we can\r find regression functions which, given a
  data point,\r can make point predictions not just for the\r expectation of its label,
  but for higher moments of\r its label distribution as well—and those predictions\r
  match the true distribution quantities when averaged\r not just over the population
  as a whole, but also\r when averaged over an enormous number of finely\r defined
  subgroups. It yields a principled way to\r estimate the uncertainty of predictions
  on many\r different subgroups—and to diagnose potential\r sources of unfairness
  in the predictive power of\r features across subgroups. As an application, we\r
  show that our moment estimates can be used to derive\r marginal prediction intervals
  that are\r simultaneously valid as averaged over all of the\r (sufficiently large)
  subgroups for which moment\r multicalibration has been obtained."
