title: Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation
abstract: We show how to achieve the notion of "multicalibration" from Hebert-Johnson
  et al. (2018) not just for means, but also for variances and other higher moments.  Informally,
  this means that we can find regression functions which, given a data point, can
  make point predictions not just for the expectation of its label, but for higher
  moments of its label distribution as well—and those predictions match the true distribution
  quantities when averaged not just over the population as a whole, but also when
  averaged over an enormous number of finely defined subgroups. It yields a principled
  way to estimate the uncertainty of predictions on many different subgroups—and to
  diagnose potential sources of unfairness in the predictive power of features across
  subgroups. As an application, we show that our moment estimates can be used to derive
  marginal prediction intervals that are simultaneously valid as averaged over all
  of the (sufficiently large) subgroups for which moment multicalibration has been
  obtained.
