title: Mirror Descent and the Information Ratio
abstract: 'We establish a connection between the stability of mirror descent and the
  information ratio by Russo and Van Roy (2014). Our analysis shows that mirror descent
  with suitable loss estimators and exploratory distributions enjoys the same bound
  on the adversarial regret as the bounds on the Bayesian regret for information-directed
  sampling. Along the way, we develop the theory for information-directed sampling
  and provide an efficient algorithm for adversarial bandits for which the regret
  upper bound matches exactly the best known information-theoretic upper bound. Keywords:
  Bandits, partial monitoring, mirror descent, information theory.'
