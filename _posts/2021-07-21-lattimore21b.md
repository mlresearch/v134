title: Mirror Descent and the Information Ratio
abstract: "We establish a connection between the stability of\r mirror descent and
  the information ratio by Russo\r and Van Roy (2014). Our analysis shows that mirror\r
  descent with suitable loss estimators and\r exploratory distributions enjoys the
  same bound on\r the adversarial regret as the bounds on the Bayesian\r regret for
  information-directed sampling. Along the\r way, we develop the theory for information-directed\r
  sampling and provide an efficient algorithm for\r adversarial bandits for which
  the regret upper bound\r matches exactly the best known information-theoretic\r
  upper bound. Keywords: Bandits, partial monitoring,\r mirror descent, information
  theory."
