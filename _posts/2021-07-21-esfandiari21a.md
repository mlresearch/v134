title: Adaptivity in Adaptive Submodularity
abstract: "Adaptive sequential decision making is one of the\r central challenges
  in machine learning and\r artificial intelligence. In such problems, the goal\r
  is to design an interactive policy that plans for an\r action to take, from a finite
  set of $n$ actions,\r given some partial observations. It has been shown\r that
  in many applications such as active learning,\r robotics, sequential experimental
  design, and active\r detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive\r submodularity,
  a notion that generalizes the notion\r of diminishing returns to policies.  In this
  paper,\r we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an\r adaptive monotone
  submodular function. We propose an\r efficient semi adaptive policy that with $O(\\log
  n\r \\times\\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can\r achieve an almost tight
  $1-1/e-\\eps$ approximation\r guarantee with respect to an optimal policy that\r
  carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential\r manner. To complement our results,
  we also show that\r it is impossible to achieve a constant factor\r approximation
  with $o(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We\r also extend our result to the case of adaptive\r
  stochastic minimum cost coverage where the goal is\r to reach a desired utility
  $Q$ with the cheapest\r policy. We first prove the long-standing conjecture\r by
  Golovin and Krause and show that the greedy\r policy achieves the asymptotically
  tight logarithmic\r approximation guarantee. We then propose a semi\r adaptive policy
  that provides the same guarantee in\r polylogarithmic adaptive rounds through a
  similar\r information-parallelism scheme. Our results shrink\r the adaptivity gap
  in adaptive submodular\r maximization by an exponential factor."
