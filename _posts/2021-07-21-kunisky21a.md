title: Hypothesis testing with low-degree polynomials in the Morris class of exponential
  families
abstract: 'Analysis of low-degree polynomial algorithms is a powerful, newly-popular
  method for predicting computational thresholds in hypothesis testing problems. One
  limitation of current techniques for this analysis is their restriction to Bernoulli
  and Gaussian distributions. We expand this range of possibilities by performing
  the low-degree analysis of hypothesis testing for the Morris class of natural exponential
  families with quadratic variance function, giving a unified treatment of Gaussian,
  Poisson, gamma (including exponential and chi-squared), binomial (including Bernoulli),
  negative binomial (including geometric), and generalized hyperbolic secant distributions.
  We then give several algorithmic applications.  1. In models where a random signal
  is observed through coordinatewise-independent noise applied in an exponential family,
  the success or failure of low-degree polynomials is governed by the z-score overlap,
  the inner product of z-score vectors with respect to the null distribution of two
  independent copies of the signal.  2. In the same models, testing with low-degree
  polynomials exhibits channel monotonicity: the above distributions admit a total
  ordering by computational cost of hypothesis testing, according to a scalar parameter
  describing how the variance depends on the mean in an exponential family.  3. In
  a spiked matrix model with a particular non-Gaussian noise distribution, the low-degree
  prediction is incorrect unless polynomials with arbitrarily large degree in individual
  matrix entries are permitted. This shows that polynomials summing over self-avoiding
  walks and variants thereof, as proposed recently by Ding, Hopkins, and Steurer (2020)
  for spiked matrix models with heavy-tailed noise, are strictly suboptimal for this
  model. Thus low-degree polynomials appear to offer a tradeoff between robustness
  and strong performance fine-tuned to specific models. Inspired by this, we suggest
  that a class of problems requiring "exploration before inference," where an algorithm
  must first examine the input and then use some intermediate computation to choose
  a suitable inference subroutine, appears especially difficult for low-degree polynomials.'
