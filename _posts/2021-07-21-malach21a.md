title: The Connection Between Approximation, Depth Separation and Learnability in
  Neural Networks
abstract: Several recent works have shown separation results between deep neural networks,
  and hypothesis classes with inferior approximation capacity such as shallow networks
  or kernel classes. On the other hand, the fact that deep networks can efficiently
  express a target function does not mean that this target function can be learned
  efficiently by deep neural networks. In this work we study the intricate connection
  between learnability and approximation capacity. We show that learnability with
  deep networks of a target function depends on the ability of simpler classes to
  approximate the target. Specifically, we show that a necessary condition for a function
  to be learnable by gradient descent on deep neural networks is to be able to approximate
  the function, at least in a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show
  that a class of functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query algorithm
  if and only if it can be approximated in a weak sense by some kernel class. We give
  several examples of functions which demonstrate depth separation, and conclude that
  they cannot be efficiently learned, even by a hypothesis class that can efficiently
  approximate them.
