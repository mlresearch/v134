title: "The Connection Between Approximation, Depth\r Separation and Learnability
  in Neural Networks"
abstract: "Several recent works have shown separation results\r between deep neural
  networks, and hypothesis classes\r with inferior approximation capacity such as
  shallow\r networks or kernel classes. On the other hand, the\r fact that deep networks
  can efficiently express a\r target function does not mean that this target\r function
  can be learned efficiently by deep neural\r networks. In this work we study the
  intricate\r connection between learnability and approximation\r capacity. We show
  that learnability with deep\r networks of a target function depends on the ability\r
  of simpler classes to approximate the\r target. Specifically, we show that a necessary\r
  condition for a function to be learnable by gradient\r descent on deep neural networks
  is to be able to\r approximate the function, at least in a weak sense,\r with shallow
  neural networks. We also show that a\r class of functions can be learned by an efficient\r
  statistical query algorithm if and only if it can be\r approximated in a weak sense
  by some kernel\r class. We give several examples of functions which\r demonstrate
  depth separation, and conclude that they\r cannot be efficiently learned, even by
  a hypothesis\r class that can efficiently approximate them."
