title: "Last-iterate Convergence of Decentralized Optimistic\r Gradient Descent/Ascent
  in Infinite-horizon\r Competitive Markov Games"
abstract: "We study infinite-horizon discounted two-player\r zero-sum Markov games,
  and develop a decentralized\r algorithm that provably converges to the set of Nash\r
  equilibria under self-play. Our algorithm is based\r on running an Optimistic Gradient
  Descent Ascent\r algorithm on each state to learn the policies, with\r a critic
  that slowly learns the value of each\r state. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the\r first algorithm in this setting that is\r simultaneously rational (converging
  to the\r opponentâ€™s best response when it uses a stationary\r policy), convergent
  (converging to the set of Nash\r equilibria under self-play), agnostic (no need
  to\r know the actions played by the opponent), symmetric\r (players taking symmetric
  roles in the algorithm),\r and enjoying a finite-time last-iterate convergence\r
  guarantee, all of which are desirable properties of\r decentralized algorithms."
