title: "Adaptive Discretization for Adversarial Lipschitz\r Bandits"
abstract: "Lipschitz bandits is a prominent version of\r multi-armed bandits that
  studies large, structured\r action spaces such as the [0,1] interval, where\r similar
  actions are guaranteed to have similar\r rewards. A central theme here is the adaptive\r
  discretization of the action space, which gradually\r \"zooms in\" on the more promising
  regions\r thereof. The goal is to take advantage of \"nicer\"\r problem instances,
  while retaining near-optimal\r worst-case performance. While the stochastic version\r
  of the problem is well-understood, the general\r version with adversarial rewards
  is not. We provide\r the first algorithm for adaptive discretization in\r the adversarial
  version, and derive\r instance-dependent regret bounds. In particular, we\r recover
  the worst-case optimal regret bound for the\r adversarial version, and the instance-dependent\r
  regret bound for the stochastic version.  A version\r with full proofs (and additional
  results) appears at\r arxiv.org/abs/2006.12367v2."
