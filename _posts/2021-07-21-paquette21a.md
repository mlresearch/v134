title: 'SGD in the Large: Average-case Analysis, Asymptotics, and Stepsize Criticality'
abstract: We propose a new framework, inspired by random matrix theory, for analyzing
  the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when both number of samples and
  dimensions are large. This framework applies to any fixed stepsize and on the least
  squares problem with random data (finite-sum). Using this new framework, we show
  that the dynamics of SGD become deterministic in the large sample and dimensional
  limit. Furthermore, the limiting dynamics are governed by a Volterra integral equation.
  This model predicts that SGD undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly given
  critical stepsize that ultimately affects its convergence rate, which is also verified
  experimentally. Finally, when input data is isotropic, we provide explicit expressions
  for the dynamics and average-case convergence rates (i.e., the complexity of an
  algorithm averaged over all possible inputs). These rates show significant improvement
  over classical worst-case complexities.
