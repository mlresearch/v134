title: A Law of Robustness for Two-Layers Neural Networks
abstract: We initiate the study of the inherent tradeoffs between the size of a neural
  network and its robustness, as measured by its Lipschitz constant. We make a precise
  conjecture that, for any Lipschitz activation function and for most datasets, any
  two-layers neural network with $k$ neurons that perfectly fit the data must have
  its Lipschitz constant larger (up to a constant) than $\sqrt{n/k}$ where $n$ is
  the number of datapoints. In particular, this conjecture implies that overparametrization
  is necessary for robustness, since it means that one needs roughly one neuron per
  datapoint to ensure a $O(1)$-Lipschitz network, while mere data fitting of $d$-dimensional
  data requires only one neuron per $d$ datapoints. We prove a weaker version of this
  conjecture when the Lipschitz constant is replaced by an upper bound on it based
  on the spectral norm of the weight matrix. We also prove the conjecture in the high-dimensional
  regime $n \approx d$ (which we also refer to as the undercomplete case, since only
  $k \leq d$ is relevant here). Finally we prove the conjecture for polynomial activation
  functions of degree $p$ when $n \approx d^p$. We complement these findings with
  experimental evidence supporting the conjecture.
