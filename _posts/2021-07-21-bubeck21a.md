title: A Law of Robustness for Two-Layers Neural Networks
abstract: "We initiate the study of the inherent tradeoffs\r between the size of a
  neural network and its\r robustness, as measured by its Lipschitz\r constant. We
  make a precise conjecture that, for any\r Lipschitz activation function and for
  most datasets,\r any two-layers neural network with $k$ neurons that\r perfectly
  fit the data must have its Lipschitz\r constant larger (up to a constant) than $\\sqrt{n/k}$\r
  where $n$ is the number of datapoints. In\r particular, this conjecture implies
  that\r overparametrization is necessary for robustness,\r since it means that one
  needs roughly one neuron per\r datapoint to ensure a $O(1)$-Lipschitz network,\r
  while mere data fitting of $d$-dimensional data\r requires only one neuron per $d$
  datapoints. We\r prove a weaker version of this conjecture when the\r Lipschitz
  constant is replaced by an upper bound on\r it based on the spectral norm of the
  weight\r matrix. We also prove the conjecture in the\r high-dimensional regime $n
  \\approx d$ (which we also\r refer to as the undercomplete case, since only $k\r
  \\leq d$ is relevant here). Finally we prove the\r conjecture for polynomial activation
  functions of\r degree $p$ when $n \\approx d^p$. We complement these\r findings
  with experimental evidence supporting the\r conjecture."
