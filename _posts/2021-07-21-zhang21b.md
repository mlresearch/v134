title: Is Reinforcement Learning More Difficult Than Bandits? A Near-optimal Algorithm
  Escaping the Curse of Horizon
abstract: Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual bandits are two widely studied
  sequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning generalizes
  contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due to long planning
  horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The current paper shows that the
  long planning horizon and the unknown state-dependent transitions (at most) pose
  little additional difficulty on sample complexity.  We consider the episodic reinforcement
  learning with S states, A actions, planning horizon H, total reward bounded by 1,
  and the agent plays for K episodes. We propose a new algorithm, Monotonic Value
  Propagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus. The new bonus only
  requires tweaking the constants to ensure optimism and thus is significantly simpler
  than existing bonus constructions. We show MVP enjoys an $O\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK}
  + S^2A\right) \poly\log \left(SAHK\right)\right)$ regret, approaching the $\Omega\left(\sqrt{SAK}\right)$
  lower bound of contextual bandits. Notably, this result 1) exponentially improves
  the state-of-the-art polynomial-time algorithms by Dann et al. [2019], Zanette et
  al. [2019], and Zhang et al. [2020] in terms of the dependency on H, and 2) exponentially
  improves the running time in [Wang et al. 2020] and significantly improves the dependency
  on S, A and K in sample complexity.
