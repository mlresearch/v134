title: Improved Algorithms for Efficient Active Learning Halfspaces with Massart and
  Tsybakov Noise
abstract: We give a computationally-efficient PAC active learning algorithm for $d$-dimensional
  homogeneous halfspaces that can tolerate Massart noise \citep{massart2006risk} and
  Tsybakov \citep{tsybakov2004optimal} noise. Specialized to the $\eta$-Massart noise
  setting, our algorithm achieves an information-theoretically near-optimal label
  complexity of $\tilde{O}\rbr{\frac{d}{(1-2\eta)^2} \polylog(\frac1\epsilon)}$ under
  a wide range of unlabeled data distributions (specifically, the family of “structured
  distributions” defined in \citet{diakonikolas2020polynomial}). Under the more challenging
  Tsybakov noise condition, we identify two subfamilies of noise conditions, under
  which our algorithm is the first to achieve computational efficiency and provide
  label complexity guarantees strictly lower than passive learning algorithms.
