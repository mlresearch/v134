title: "Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning for\r Linear Mixture Markov
  Decision Processes"
abstract: "We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear\r function approximation
  where the underlying\r transition probability kernel of the Markov decision\r process
  (MDP) is a linear mixture model (Jia et al.,\r 2020; Ayoub et al., 2020; Zhou et
  al., 2020) and the\r learning agent has access to either an integration\r or a sampling
  oracle of the individual basis\r kernels. For the fixed-horizon episodic setting
  with\r inhomogeneous transition kernels, we propose a new,\r computationally efficient
  algorithm that uses the\r basis kernels to approximate value functions. We\r show
  that the new algorithm, which we call\r ${\\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}}$, attains an $\\tilde\r
  O(dH\\sqrt{T})$ regret where $d$ is the number of\r basis kernels, $H$ is the length
  of the episode and\r $T$ is the number of interactions with the MDP. We\r also prove
  a matching lower bound\r $\\Omega(dH\\sqrt{T})$ for this setting, which shows\r
  that ${\\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}}$ is minimax optimal up\r to logarithmic factors. At
  the core of our results\r are (1) a weighted least squares estimator for the\r unknown
  transitional probability; and (2) a new\r Bernstein-type concentration inequality
  for\r self-normalized vector-valued martingales with\r bounded increments. Together,
  these new tools enable\r tight control of the Bellman error and lead to a\r nearly
  minimax regret. To the best of our knowledge,\r this is the first computationally
  efficient, nearly\r minimax optimal algorithm for RL with linear\r function approximation."
