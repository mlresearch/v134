title: Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Linear Mixture Markov Decision
  Processes
abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation
  where the underlying transition probability kernel of the Markov decision process
  (MDP) is a linear mixture model (Jia et al., 2020; Ayoub et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
  2020) and the learning agent has access to either an integration or a sampling oracle
  of the individual basis kernels. For the fixed-horizon episodic setting with inhomogeneous
  transition kernels, we propose a new, computationally efficient algorithm that uses
  the basis kernels to approximate value functions. We show that the new algorithm,
  which we call ${\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}}$, attains an $\tilde O(dH\sqrt{T})$ regret
  where $d$ is the number of basis kernels, $H$ is the length of the episode and $T$
  is the number of interactions with the MDP. We also prove a matching lower bound
  $\Omega(dH\sqrt{T})$ for this setting, which shows that ${\text{UCRL-VTR}^{+}}$
  is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. At the core of our results are (1)
  a weighted least squares estimator for the unknown transitional probability; and
  (2) a new Bernstein-type concentration inequality for self-normalized vector-valued
  martingales with bounded increments. Together, these new tools enable tight control
  of the Bellman error and lead to a nearly minimax regret. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first computationally efficient, nearly minimax optimal algorithm for
  RL with linear function approximation.
