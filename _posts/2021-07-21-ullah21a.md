title: Machine Unlearning via Algorithmic Stability
abstract: "We study the problem of machine unlearning and\r identify a notion of algorithmic
  stability, Total\r Variation (TV) stability, which we argue, is\r suitable for the
  goal of exact unlearning. For\r convex risk minimization problems, we design\r TV-stable
  algorithms based on noisy Stochastic\r Gradient Descent (SGD). Our key contribution
  is the\r design of corresponding efficient unlearning\r algorithms, which are based
  on constructing a\r near-maximal coupling of Markov chains for the noisy\r SGD procedure.
  To understand the trade-offs between\r accuracy and unlearning efficiency, we give
  upper\r and lower bounds on excess empirical and populations\r risk of TV stable
  algorithms for convex risk\r minimization. Our techniques generalize to arbitrary\r
  non-convex functions, and our algorithms are\r differentially private as well."
