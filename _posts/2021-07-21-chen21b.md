title: "Learning and testing junta distributions with sub\r cube conditioning"
abstract: "We study the problems of learning and testing junta\r distributions on
  $\\{-1,1\\}^n$ with respect to the\r uniform distribution, where a distribution
  $p$ is a\r $k$-junta if its probability mass function $p(x)$\r depends on a subset
  of at most $k$ variables.  The\r main contribution is an algorithm for finding\r
  relevant coordinates in a $k$-junta distribution\r with subcube conditioning (Bhattacharyya
  et al\r 2018., Canonne et al. 2019). We give two\r applications: \\begin{itemize}
  \\item An algorithm for\r learning $k$-junta distributions with\r $\\tilde{O}(k/\\eps^2)
  \\log n + O(2^k/\\eps^2)$ subcube\r conditioning queries, and \\item An algorithm
  for\r testing $k$-junta distributions with $\\tilde{O}((k +\r \\sqrt{n})/\\eps^2)$
  subcube conditioning queries.\r \\end{itemize} All our algorithms are optimal up
  to\r poly-logarithmic factors.  Our results show that\r subcube conditioning, as
  a natural model for\r accessing high-dimensional distributions, enables\r significant
  savings in learning and testing junta\r distributions compared to the standard sampling\r
  model.  This addresses an open question posed by\r Aliakbarpour et al 2016."
