title: "Benign Overfitting of Constant-Stepsize SGD for\r Linear Regression"
abstract: "There is an increasing realization that algorithmic\r inductive biases
  are central in preventing\r overfitting; empirically, we often see a benign\r overfitting
  phenomenon in overparameterized settings\r for natural learning algorithms, such
  as stochastic\r gradient descent (SGD), where little to no explicit\r regularization
  has been employed. This work\r considers this issue in arguably the most basic\r
  setting: constant-stepsize SGD (with iterate\r averaging) for linear regression
  in the\r overparameterized regime. Our main result provides a\r sharp excess risk
  bound, stated in terms of the full\r eigenspectrum of the data covariance matrix,
  that\r reveals a bias-variance decomposition characterizing\r when generalization
  is possible: (i) the variance\r bound is characterized in terms of an effective\r
  dimension and (ii) the bias bound provides a sharp\r geometric characterization
  in terms of the location\r of the initial iterate (and how it aligns with the\r
  data covariance matrix). We reflect on a number of\r notable differences between
  the algorithmic\r regularization afforded by (unregularized) SGD in\r comparison
  to ordinary least squares (minimum-norm\r interpolation) and ridge regression."
