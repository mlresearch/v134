title: Benign Overfitting of Constant-Stepsize SGD for Linear Regression
abstract: 'There is an increasing realization that algorithmic inductive biases are
  central in preventing overfitting; empirically, we often see a benign overfitting
  phenomenon in overparameterized settings for natural learning algorithms, such as
  stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where little to no explicit regularization has
  been employed. This work considers this issue in arguably the most basic setting:
  constant-stepsize SGD (with iterate averaging) for linear regression in the overparameterized
  regime. Our main result provides a sharp excess risk bound, stated in terms of the
  full eigenspectrum of the data covariance matrix, that reveals a bias-variance decomposition
  characterizing when generalization is possible: (i) the variance bound is characterized
  in terms of an effective dimension and (ii) the bias bound provides a sharp geometric
  characterization in terms of the location of the initial iterate (and how it aligns
  with the data covariance matrix). We reflect on a number of notable differences
  between the algorithmic regularization afforded by (unregularized) SGD in comparison
  to ordinary least squares (minimum-norm interpolation) and ridge regression.'
