title: "Quantifying Variational Approximation for\r Log-Partition Function"
abstract: "Variational methods, such as mean-field (MF) and\r tree-reweighted (TRW),
  provide computationally\r efficient approximations of the log-partition\r function
  for generic graphical models but their\r approximation ratio is generally not quantified.
  \ %\r As the primary contribution of this work, we provide\r an approach to quantify
  their approximation ratio\r for any discrete pairwise graphical model with\r non-negative
  potentials through a property of the\r underlying graph structure $G$.  % Specifically,
  we\r argue that (a variant of) TRW produces an estimate\r within factor $1/\\sqrt{\\kappa(G)}$
  where $\\kappa(G)\r \\in (0,1]$ captures how far $G$ is from tree\r structure.  %
  As a consequence, the approximation\r ratio is $1$ for trees, $\\sqrt{(d+1)/2}$
  for graphs\r with maximum average degree $d$ and\r $1+1/(2\\beta)+o_{\\beta\\to
  \\infty}(1/\\beta)$ for\r graphs with girth at least $\\beta \\log N$.  % The\r
  quantity $\\kappa(G)$ is the solution of a min-max\r problem associated with the
  spanning tree polytope\r of $G$ that can be evaluated in polynomial time for\r any
  graph.  % We provide a near linear-time variant\r that achieves an approximation
  ratio depending on\r the minimal (across edges) effective resistance of\r the graph.
  We connect our results to the graph\r partition approximation method and thus provide
  a\r unified perspective."
