title: Quantifying Variational Approximation for Log-Partition Function
abstract: Variational methods, such as mean-field (MF) and tree-reweighted (TRW),
  provide computationally efficient approximations of the log-partition function for
  generic graphical models but their approximation ratio is generally not quantified.  %
  As the primary contribution of this work, we provide an approach to quantify their
  approximation ratio for any discrete pairwise graphical model with non-negative
  potentials through a property of the underlying graph structure $G$.  % Specifically,
  we argue that (a variant of) TRW produces an estimate within factor $1/\sqrt{\kappa(G)}$
  where $\kappa(G) \in (0,1]$ captures how far $G$ is from tree structure.  % As a
  consequence, the approximation ratio is $1$ for trees, $\sqrt{(d+1)/2}$ for graphs
  with maximum average degree $d$ and $1+1/(2\beta)+o_{\beta\to \infty}(1/\beta)$
  for graphs with girth at least $\beta \log N$.  % The quantity $\kappa(G)$ is the
  solution of a min-max problem associated with the spanning tree polytope of $G$
  that can be evaluated in polynomial time for any graph.  % We provide a near linear-time
  variant that achieves an approximation ratio depending on the minimal (across edges)
  effective resistance of the graph. We connect our results to the graph partition
  approximation method and thus provide a unified perspective.
