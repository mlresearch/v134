title: "Modeling from Features: a Mean-field Framework for\r Over-parameterized Deep
  Neural Networks"
abstract: "This paper proposes a new mean-field framework for\r over-parameterized
  deep neural networks (DNNs),\r which can be used to analyze neural network\r training.
  \ In this framework, a DNN is represented\r by probability measures and functions
  over its\r features (that is, the function values of the hidden\r units over the
  training data) in the continuous\r limit, instead of the neural network parameters
  as\r most existing studies have done. This new\r representation overcomes the degenerate
  situation\r where all the hidden units essentially have only one\r meaningful hidden
  unit in each middle layer, leading\r to a simpler representation of DNNs. Moreover,
  we\r construct a non-linear dynamics called neural\r feature flow, which captures
  the evolution of an\r over-parameterized DNN trained by Gradient\r Descent. We illustrate
  the framework via the\r Residual Network (Res-Net) architecture.  It is\r shown
  that when the neural feature flow process\r converges, it reaches a global minimal
  solution\r under suitable conditions."
