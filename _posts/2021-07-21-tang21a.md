title: 'On Empirical Bayes Variational Autoencoder: An Excess Risk Bound'
abstract: In this paper, we consider variational autoencoders (VAE) via empirical
  Bayes estimation, referred to as Empirical Bayes Variational Autoencoders (EBVAE),
  which is a general framework including popular VAE methods as special cases. Despite
  the widespread use of VAE, its theoretical aspects are less explored in the literature.
  Motivated by this, we establish a general theoretical framework for analyzing the
  excess risk associated with EBVAE under the setting of density estimation, covering
  both parametric and nonparametric cases, through the lens of M-estimation. As an
  application, we analyze the excess risk of the commonly-used EBVAE with Gaussian
  models and highlight the importance of covariance matrices of Gaussian encoders
  and decoders in obtaining a good statistical guarantee, shedding light on the empirical
  observations reported in the literature.
