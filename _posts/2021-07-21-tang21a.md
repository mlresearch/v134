title: "On Empirical Bayes Variational Autoencoder: An\r Excess Risk Bound"
abstract: "In this paper, we consider variational autoencoders\r (VAE) via empirical
  Bayes estimation, referred to as\r Empirical Bayes Variational Autoencoders (EBVAE),\r
  which is a general framework including popular VAE\r methods as special cases. Despite
  the widespread use\r of VAE, its theoretical aspects are less explored in\r the
  literature. Motivated by this, we establish a\r general theoretical framework for
  analyzing the\r excess risk associated with EBVAE under the setting\r of density
  estimation, covering both parametric and\r nonparametric cases, through the lens
  of\r M-estimation. As an application, we analyze the\r excess risk of the commonly-used
  EBVAE with Gaussian\r models and highlight the importance of covariance\r matrices
  of Gaussian encoders and decoders in\r obtaining a good statistical guarantee, shedding\r
  light on the empirical observations reported in the\r literature."
