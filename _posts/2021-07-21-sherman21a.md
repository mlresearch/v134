title: "Lazy OCO: Online Convex Optimization on a Switching\r Budget"
abstract: "We study a variant of online convex optimization\r where the player is
  permitted to switch decisions at\r most $S$ times in expectation throughout $T$\r
  rounds. Similar problems have been addressed in\r prior work for the discrete decision
  set setting,\r and more recently in the continuous setting but only\r with an adaptive
  adversary.  In this work, we aim to\r fill the gap and present computationally efficient\r
  algorithms in the more prevalent oblivious setting,\r establishing a regret bound
  of $O(T/S)$ for general\r convex losses and $\\widetilde O(T/S^2)$ for strongly\r
  convex losses. In addition, for stochastic\r i.i.d.Â losses, we present a simple
  algorithm that\r performs $\\log T$ switches with only a\r multiplicative $\\log
  T$ factor overhead in its\r regret in both the general and strongly convex\r settings.
  \ Finally, we complement our algorithms\r with lower bounds that match our upper
  bounds in\r some of the cases we consider."
