title: "Fine-Grained Gap-Dependent Bounds for Tabular MDPs\r via Adaptive Multi-Step
  Bootstrap"
abstract: "This paper presents a new model-free algorithm for\r episodic finite-horizon
  Markov Decision Processes\r (MDP), Adaptive Multi-step Bootstrap (AMB), which\r
  enjoys a stronger gap-dependent regret bound. The\r first innovation is to estimate
  the optimal\r $Q$-function by combining an optimistic bootstrap\r with an adaptive
  multi-step Monte Carlo rollout. The\r second innovation is to select the action
  with the\r largest confidence interval length among admissible\r actions that are
  not dominated by any other\r actions. We show when each state has a unique\r optimal
  action, AMB achieves a gap-dependent regret\r bound that only scales with the sum
  of the inverse\r of the sub-optimality gaps. In contrast, Simchowitz\r and Jamieson
  (2019) showed all\r upper-confidence-bound (UCB) algorithms suffer an\r additional
  $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{S}{\\gapmin}\\right)$\r regret due to over-exploration where
  $\\gapmin$ is\r the minimum sub-optimality gap and $S$ is the number\r of states.
  We further show that for general MDPs,\r AMB suffers an additional $\\frac{|\\zmul|}{\\gapmin}$\r
  regret, where $\\zmul$ is the set of state-action\r pairs $(s,a)$â€™s satisfying $a$
  is a non-unique\r optimal action for $s$. We complement our upper\r bound with a
  lower bound showing the dependency on\r $\\frac{|\\zmul|}{\\gapmin}$ is unavoidable
  for any\r consistent algorithm. This lower bound also implies\r a separation between
  reinforcement learning and\r contextual bandits."
