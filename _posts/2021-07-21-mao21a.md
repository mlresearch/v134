title: "Random Graph Matching with Improved Noise\r Robustness"
abstract: "Graph matching, also known as network alignment,\r refers to finding a
  bijection between the vertex\r sets of two given graphs so as to maximally align\r
  their edges. This fundamental computational problem\r arises frequently in multiple
  fields such as\r computer vision and biology. Recently, there has\r been a plethora
  of work studying efficient\r algorithms for graph matching under probabilistic\r
  models. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for\r graph matching: Our algorithm
  associates each vertex\r with a signature vector using a multistage procedure\r
  and then matches a pair of vertices from the two\r graphs if their signature vectors
  are close to each\r other. We show that, for two Erdős–Rényi\r graphs with edge
  correlation $1-\\alpha$, our\r algorithm recovers the underlying matching exactly\r
  with high probability when $\\alpha \\le 1 / (\\log\r \\log n)^C$, where $n$ is
  the number of vertices in\r each graph and $C$ denotes a positive universal\r constant.
  This improves the condition $\\alpha \\le 1\r / (\\log n)^C$ achieved in previous
  work."
