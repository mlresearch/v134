title: Random Graph Matching with Improved Noise Robustness
abstract: 'Graph matching, also known as network alignment, refers to finding a bijection
  between the vertex sets of two given graphs so as to maximally align their edges.
  This fundamental computational problem arises frequently in multiple fields such
  as computer vision and biology. Recently, there has been a plethora of work studying
  efficient algorithms for graph matching under probabilistic models. In this work,
  we propose a new algorithm for graph matching: Our algorithm associates each vertex
  with a signature vector using a multistage procedure and then matches a pair of
  vertices from the two graphs if their signature vectors are close to each other.
  We show that, for two Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge correlation $1-\alpha$, our algorithm
  recovers the underlying matching exactly with high probability when $\alpha \le
  1 / (\log \log n)^C$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in each graph and $C$
  denotes a positive universal constant. This improves the condition $\alpha \le 1
  / (\log n)^C$ achieved in previous work.'
