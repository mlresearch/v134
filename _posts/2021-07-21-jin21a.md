title: 'Double Explore-then-Commit: Asymptotic Optimality and Beyond'
abstract: We study the multi-armed bandit problem with subGaussian rewards. The explore-then-commit
  (ETC) strategy, which consists of an exploration phase followed by an exploitation
  phase, is one of the most widely used algorithms in a variety of online decision
  applications. Nevertheless, it has been shown in \cite{garivier2016explore} that
  ETC is suboptimal in the asymptotic sense as the horizon grows, and thus, is worse
  than fully sequential strategies such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In this paper,
  we show that a variant of ETC algorithm can actually achieve the asymptotic optimality
  for multi-armed bandit problems as UCB-type algorithms do and extend it to the batched
  bandit setting. Specifically, we propose a double explore-then-commit (DETC) algorithm
  that has two exploration and exploitation phases and proves that DETC achieves the
  asymptotically optimal regret bound. To our knowledge, DETC is the first non-fully-sequential
  algorithm that achieves such asymptotic optimality. In addition, we extend DETC
  to batched bandit problems, where (i) the exploration process is split into a small
  number of batches and (ii) the round complexity is of central interest. We prove
  that a batched version of DETC can achieve the asymptotic optimality with only a
  constant round complexity. This is the first batched bandit algorithm that can attain
  the optimal asymptotic regret bound and optimal round complexity simultaneously.
