title: "Double Explore-then-Commit: Asymptotic Optimality\r and Beyond"
abstract: "We study the multi-armed bandit problem with\r subGaussian rewards. The
  explore-then-commit (ETC)\r strategy, which consists of an exploration phase\r followed
  by an exploitation phase, is one of the\r most widely used algorithms in a variety
  of online\r decision applications. Nevertheless, it has been\r shown in \\cite{garivier2016explore}
  that ETC is\r suboptimal in the asymptotic sense as the horizon\r grows, and thus,
  is worse than fully sequential\r strategies such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).
  In\r this paper, we show that a variant of ETC algorithm\r can actually achieve
  the asymptotic optimality for\r multi-armed bandit problems as UCB-type algorithms\r
  do and extend it to the batched bandit\r setting. Specifically, we propose a double\r
  explore-then-commit (DETC) algorithm that has two\r exploration and exploitation
  phases and proves that\r DETC achieves the asymptotically optimal regret\r bound.
  To our knowledge, DETC is the first\r non-fully-sequential algorithm that achieves
  such\r asymptotic optimality. In addition, we extend DETC\r to batched bandit problems,
  where (i) the\r exploration process is split into a small number of\r batches and
  (ii) the round complexity is of central\r interest. We prove that a batched version
  of DETC\r can achieve the asymptotic optimality with only a\r constant round complexity.
  This is the first batched\r bandit algorithm that can attain the optimal\r asymptotic
  regret bound and optimal round complexity\r simultaneously."
