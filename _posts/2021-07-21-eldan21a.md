title: "Non-asymptotic approximations of neural networks by\r Gaussian processes"
abstract: "We study the extent to which wide neural networks\r may be approximated
  by Gaussian processes, when\r initialized with random weights. It is a\r well-established
  fact that as the width of a network\r goes to infinity, its law converges to that
  of a\r Gaussian process. We make this quantitative by\r establishing explicit convergence
  rates for the\r central limit theorem in an infinite-dimensional\r functional space,
  metrized with a natural\r transportation distance. We identify two regimes of\r
  interest; when the activation function is\r polynomial, its degree determines the
  rate of\r convergence, while for non-polynomial activations,\r the rate is governed
  by the smoothness of the\r function."
