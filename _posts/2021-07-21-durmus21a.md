title: 'On the Stability of Random Matrix Product with Markovian Noise: Application
  to Linear Stochastic Approximation and TD Learning'
abstract: This paper studies the exponential stability of random matrix products driven
  by a general (possibly unbounded) state space Markov chain. It is a cornerstone
  in the analysis of stochastic algorithms in machine learning (e.g. for parameter
  tracking in online-learning or reinforcement learning). The existing results impose
  strong conditions such as uniform boundedness of the matrix-valued functions and
  uniform ergodicity of the Markov chains.  Our main contribution is an exponential
  stability result for the p-th moment of random matrix product, provided that (i)
  the underlying Markov chain satisfies a super-Lyapunov drift condition, (ii) the
  growth of the matrix-valued functions is controlled by an appropriately defined
  function (related to the drift condition). Using this result, we give finite-time
  p-th moment bounds for constant and decreasing stepsize linear stochastic approximation
  schemes with Markovian noise on general state space. We illustrate these findings
  for linear value-function estimation in reinforcement learning. We provide finite-time
  p-th moment bound for various members of temporal difference (TD) family of algorithms.
