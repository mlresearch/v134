title: "On the Stability of Random Matrix Product with\r Markovian Noise: Application
  to Linear Stochastic\r Approximation and TD Learning"
abstract: "This paper studies the exponential stability of\r random matrix products
  driven by a general (possibly\r unbounded) state space Markov chain. It is a\r cornerstone
  in the analysis of stochastic algorithms\r in machine learning (e.g. for parameter
  tracking in\r online-learning or reinforcement learning). The\r existing results
  impose strong conditions such as\r uniform boundedness of the matrix-valued functions\r
  and uniform ergodicity of the Markov chains.  Our\r main contribution is an exponential
  stability result\r for the p-th moment of random matrix product,\r provided that
  (i) the underlying Markov chain\r satisfies a super-Lyapunov drift condition, (ii)
  the\r growth of the matrix-valued functions is controlled\r by an appropriately
  defined function (related to the\r drift condition). Using this result, we give\r
  finite-time p-th moment bounds for constant and\r decreasing stepsize linear stochastic
  approximation\r schemes with Markovian noise on general state\r space. We illustrate
  these findings for linear\r value-function estimation in reinforcement\r learning.
  We provide finite-time p-th moment bound\r for various members of temporal difference
  (TD)\r family of algorithms."
