title: "Structured Logconcave Sampling with a Restricted\r Gaussian Oracle"
abstract: "We give algorithms for sampling several structured\r logconcave families
  to high accuracy. We further\r develop a reduction framework, inspired by proximal\r
  point methods in convex optimization, which\r bootstraps samplers for regularized
  densities to\r generically improve dependences on problem\r conditioning $\\kappa$
  from polynomial to linear. A\r key ingredient in our framework is the notion of
  a\r “restricted Gaussian oracle” (RGO) for $g:\r \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$,
  which is a\r sampler for distributions whose negative\r log-likelihood sums a quadratic
  (in a multiple of\r the identity) and $g$. By combining our reduction\r framework
  with our new samplers, we obtain the\r following bounds for sampling structured\r
  distributions to total variation distance\r $\\epsilon$.  \\begin{itemize} \\item
  For composite\r densities $\\exp(-f(x) - g(x))$, where $f$ has\r condition number
  $\\kappa$ and convex (but possibly\r non-smooth) $g$ admits an RGO, we obtain a
  mixing\r time of $O(\\kappa d \\log^3\\tfrac{\\kappa\r d}{\\epsilon})$, matching
  the state-of-the-art\r non-composite bound \\cite{LeeST20}. No composite\r samplers
  with better mixing than general-purpose\r logconcave samplers were previously known.
  \ \\item\r For logconcave finite sums $\\exp(-F(x))$, where\r $F(x) = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i
  \\in [n]} f_i(x)$ has\r condition number $\\kappa$, we give a sampler\r querying
  $\\widetilde{O}(n + \\kappa\\max(d,\r \\sqrt{nd}))$ gradient oracles to $\\{f_i\\}_{i
  \\in\r [n]}$. No high-accuracy samplers with nontrivial\r gradient query complexity
  were previously known.\r \\item For densities with condition number $\\kappa$,\r
  we give an algorithm obtaining mixing time $O(\\kappa\r d \\log^2\\tfrac{\\kappa
  d}{\\epsilon})$, improving\r \\cite{LeeST20} by a logarithmic factor with a\r significantly
  simpler analysis. We also show a\r zeroth-order algorithm attains the same query\r
  complexity.  \\end{itemize}"
