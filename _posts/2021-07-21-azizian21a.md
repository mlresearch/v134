title: "The Last-Iterate Convergence Rate of Optimistic\r Mirror Descent in Stochastic
  Variational\r Inequalities"
abstract: "In this paper, we analyze the local convergence rate\r of optimistic mirror
  descent methods in stochastic\r variational inequalities, a class of optimization\r
  problems with important applications to learning\r theory and machine learning.
  Our analysis reveals an\r intricate relation between the algorithm’s rate of\r convergence
  and the local geometry induced by the\r method’s underlying Bregman function. We
  quantify\r this relation by means of the Legendre exponent, a\r notion that we introduce
  to measure the growth rate\r of the Bregman divergence relative to the ambient\r
  norm near a solution. We show that this exponent\r determines both the optimal step-size
  policy of the\r algorithm and the optimal rates attained, explaining\r in this way
  the differences observed for some\r popular Bregman functions (Euclidean projection,\r
  negative entropy, fractional power, etc.)."
