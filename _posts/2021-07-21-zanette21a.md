title: "Cautiously Optimistic Policy Optimization and\r Exploration with Linear Function
  Approximation"
abstract: "Policy optimization methods are popular\r reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
  because\r their incremental and on-policy nature makes them\r more stable than the
  value-based\r counterparts. However, the same properties also make\r them slow to
  converge and sample inefficient, as the\r on-policy nature is not amenable to data
  reuse and\r the incremental updates result in a large iteration\r complexity before
  a near optimal policy is\r discovered. These empirical findings are mirrored in\r
  theory in the recent work ofÂ \\citet{agarwal2020pc},\r which provides a policy optimization
  method PC-PG\r that provably finds near optimal policies in the\r linear MDP model
  and is robust to model\r misspecification, but suffers from an extremely poor\r
  sample complexity compared with value-based\r techniques.  In this paper, we propose
  a new\r algorithm, COPOE, that overcomes the poor sample\r complexity of PC-PG while
  retaining the robustness\r to model misspecification.  COPOE makes several\r important
  algorithmic enhancements of PC-PG, such as\r enabling data reuse, and uses more
  refined analysis\r techniques, which we expect to be more broadly\r applicable to
  designing new RL algorithms.  The\r result is an improvement in sample complexity
  from\r $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^{11})$ for PC-PG to\r $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$
  for COPOE, nearly\r bridging the gap with value-based techniques."
