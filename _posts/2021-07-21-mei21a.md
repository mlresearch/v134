title: Learning with invariances in random features and kernel models
abstract: 'A number of machine learning tasks entail a high degree of invariance:
  the data distribution does not change if we act on the data with a certain group
  of transformations. For instance, labels of images are invariant under translations
  of the images. Certain neural network architectures —for instance, convolutional
  networks—are believed to owe their success to the fact that they exploit such invariance
  properties. With the objective of quantifying the gain achieved by invariant architectures,
  we introduce two classes of models: invariant random features and invariant kernel
  methods. The latter includes, as a special case, the neural tangent kernel for convolutional
  networks with global average pooling. We consider uniform covariates distributions
  on the sphere and hypercube and a general invariant target function. We characterize
  the test error of invariant methods in a high-dimensional regime in which the sample
  size and number of hidden units scale as polynomials in the dimension, for a class
  of groups that we call ‘degeneracy $\alpha$’, with $\alpha \leq 1$. We show that
  exploiting invariance in the architecture saves a $d^\alpha$ factor ($d$ stands
  for the dimension) in sample size and number of hidden units to achieve the same
  test error as for unstructured architectures. Finally, we show that output symmetrization
  of an unstructured kernel estimator does not give a significant statistical improvement;
  on the other hand, data augmentation with an unstructured kernel estimator is equivalent
  to an invariant kernel estimator and enjoys the same improvement in statistical
  efficiency.'
