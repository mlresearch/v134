title: "Learning with invariances in random features and\r kernel models"
abstract: "A number of machine learning tasks entail a high\r degree of invariance:
  the data distribution does not\r change if we act on the data with a certain group
  of\r transformations. For instance, labels of images are\r invariant under translations
  of the images. Certain\r neural network architectures —for instance,\r convolutional
  networks—are believed to owe their\r success to the fact that they exploit such\r
  invariance properties. With the objective of\r quantifying the gain achieved by
  invariant\r architectures, we introduce two classes of models:\r invariant random
  features and invariant kernel\r methods. The latter includes, as a special case,
  the\r neural tangent kernel for convolutional networks\r with global average pooling.
  We consider uniform\r covariates distributions on the sphere and hypercube\r and
  a general invariant target function. We\r characterize the test error of invariant
  methods in\r a high-dimensional regime in which the sample size\r and number of
  hidden units scale as polynomials in\r the dimension, for a class of groups that
  we call\r ‘degeneracy $\\alpha$’, with $\\alpha \\leq 1$. We show\r that exploiting
  invariance in the architecture saves\r a $d^\\alpha$ factor ($d$ stands for the
  dimension)\r in sample size and number of hidden units to achieve\r the same test
  error as for unstructured\r architectures. Finally, we show that output\r symmetrization
  of an unstructured kernel estimator\r does not give a significant statistical improvement;\r
  on the other hand, data augmentation with an\r unstructured kernel estimator is
  equivalent to an\r invariant kernel estimator and enjoys the same\r improvement
  in statistical efficiency."
