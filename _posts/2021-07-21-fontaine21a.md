title: "Convergence rates and approximation results for SGD\r and its continuous-time
  counterpart"
abstract: "This paper proposes a thorough theoretical analysis\r of Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (SGD) with\r non-increasing step sizes.  First, we show that the\r recursion
  defining SGD can be provably approximated\r by solutions of a time inhomogeneous
  Stochastic\r Differential Equation (SDE) using an appropriate\r coupling. In the
  specific case of a batch noise we\r refine our results using recent advances in
  Stein’s\r method. Then, motivated by recent analyses of\r deterministic and stochastic
  optimization methods by\r their continuous counterpart, we study the long-time\r
  behavior of the continuous processes at hand and\r establish non-asymptotic bounds.
  To that purpose, we\r develop new comparison techniques which are of\r independent
  interest. Adapting these techniques to\r the discrete setting, we show that the
  same results\r hold for the corresponding SGD sequences.  In our\r analysis, we
  notably improve non-asymptotic bounds\r in the convex setting for SGD under weaker\r
  assumptions than the ones considered in previous\r works. Finally, we also establish
  finite-time\r convergence results under various conditions,\r including relaxations
  of the famous Ł{ojasciewicz}\r inequality, which can be applied to a class of\r
  non-convex functions."
