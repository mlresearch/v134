title: Convergence rates and approximation results for SGD and its continuous-time
  counterpart
abstract: This paper proposes a thorough theoretical analysis of Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (SGD) with non-increasing step sizes.  First, we show that the recursion
  defining SGD can be provably approximated by solutions of a time inhomogeneous Stochastic
  Differential Equation (SDE) using an appropriate coupling. In the specific case
  of a batch noise we refine our results using recent advances in Stein’s method.
  Then, motivated by recent analyses of deterministic and stochastic optimization
  methods by their continuous counterpart, we study the long-time behavior of the
  continuous processes at hand and establish non-asymptotic bounds. To that purpose,
  we develop new comparison techniques which are of independent interest. Adapting
  these techniques to the discrete setting, we show that the same results hold for
  the corresponding SGD sequences.  In our analysis, we notably improve non-asymptotic
  bounds in the convex setting for SGD under weaker assumptions than the ones considered
  in previous works. Finally, we also establish finite-time convergence results under
  various conditions, including relaxations of the famous Ł{ojasciewicz} inequality,
  which can be applied to a class of non-convex functions.
