title: Impossibility of Partial Recovery in the Graph Alignment Problem
abstract: Random graph alignment refers to recovering the underlying vertex correspondence
  between two random graphs with correlated edges. This can be viewed as an average-case
  and noisy version of the well-known graph isomorphism problem. For the correlated
  Erdös-Rényi model, we prove the first impossibility result for partial recovery
  in the sparse regime (with constant average degree). Our bound is tight in the noiseless
  case (the graph isomorphism problem) and we conjecture that it is still tight with
  noise. Our proof technique relies on a careful application of the probabilistic
  method to build automorphisms between tree components of a subcritical Erdös-Rényi
  graph.
