title: Towards a Dimension-Free Understanding of Adaptive Linear Control
abstract: We study the problem of adaptive control of the linear quadratic regulator
  for systems in very high, or even infinite dimension. We demonstrate that while
  sublinear regret requires finite dimensional inputs, the ambient state dimension
  of the system need not be bounded in order to perform online control. We provide
  the first regret bounds for LQR which hold for infinite dimensional systems, replacing
  dependence on ambient dimension with more natural notions of problem complexity.
  Our guarantees arise from a novel perturbation bound for certainty equivalence which
  scales with the prediction error in estimating the system parameters, without requiring
  consistent parameter recovery in more stringent measures like the operator norm.
  When specialized to finite dimensional settings, our bounds recover near optimal
  dimension and time horizon dependence.
