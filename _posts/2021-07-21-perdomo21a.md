title: "Towards a Dimension-Free Understanding of Adaptive\r Linear Control"
abstract: "We study the problem of adaptive control of the\r linear quadratic regulator
  for systems in very high,\r or even infinite dimension. We demonstrate that\r while
  sublinear regret requires finite dimensional\r inputs, the ambient state dimension
  of the system\r need not be bounded in order to perform online\r control. We provide
  the first regret bounds for LQR\r which hold for infinite dimensional systems,\r
  replacing dependence on ambient dimension with more\r natural notions of problem
  complexity. Our\r guarantees arise from a novel perturbation bound for\r certainty
  equivalence which scales with the\r prediction error in estimating the system\r
  parameters, without requiring consistent parameter\r recovery in more stringent
  measures like the\r operator norm. When specialized to finite\r dimensional settings,
  our bounds recover near\r optimal dimension and time horizon dependence."
