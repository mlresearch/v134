title: From Local Pseudorandom Generators to Hardness of Learning
abstract: 'We prove hardness-of-learning results under a well-studied assumption on
  the existence of local pseudorandom generators. As we show, this assumption allows
  us to surpass the current state of the art, and prove hardness of various basic
  problems, with no hardness results to date.  Our results include: hardness of learning
  shallow ReLU neural networks under the Gaussian distribution and other distributions;
  hardness of learning intersections of $\omega(1)$ halfspaces, DNF formulas with
  $\omega(1)$ terms, and ReLU networks with $\omega(1)$ hidden neurons; hardness of
  weakly learning deterministic finite automata under the uniform distribution; hardness
  of weakly learning depth-$3$ Boolean circuits under the uniform distribution, as
  well as distribution-specific hardness results for learning DNF formulas and intersections
  of halfspaces. We also establish lower bounds on the complexity of learning intersections
  of a constant number of halfspaces, and ReLU networks with a constant number of
  hidden neurons. Moreover, our results imply the hardness of virtually all improper
  PAC-learning problems (both distribution-free and distribution-specific) that were
  previously shown hard under other assumptions.'
