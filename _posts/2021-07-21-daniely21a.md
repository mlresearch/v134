title: "From Local Pseudorandom Generators to Hardness of\r Learning"
abstract: "We prove hardness-of-learning results under a\r well-studied assumption
  on the existence of local\r pseudorandom generators. As we show, this assumption\r
  allows us to surpass the current state of the art,\r and prove hardness of various
  basic problems, with\r no hardness results to date.  Our results include:\r hardness
  of learning shallow ReLU neural networks\r under the Gaussian distribution and other\r
  distributions; hardness of learning intersections of\r $\\omega(1)$ halfspaces,
  DNF formulas with\r $\\omega(1)$ terms, and ReLU networks with\r $\\omega(1)$ hidden
  neurons; hardness of weakly\r learning deterministic finite automata under the\r
  uniform distribution; hardness of weakly learning\r depth-$3$ Boolean circuits under
  the uniform\r distribution, as well as distribution-specific\r hardness results
  for learning DNF formulas and\r intersections of halfspaces. We also establish lower\r
  bounds on the complexity of learning intersections\r of a constant number of halfspaces,
  and ReLU\r networks with a constant number of hidden\r neurons. Moreover, our results
  imply the hardness of\r virtually all improper PAC-learning problems (both\r distribution-free
  and distribution-specific) that\r were previously shown hard under other assumptions."
