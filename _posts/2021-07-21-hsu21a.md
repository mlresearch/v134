title: On the Approximation Power of Two-Layer Networks of Random ReLUs
abstract: 'This paper considers the following question: how well can depth-two ReLU
  networks with randomly initialized bottom-level weights represent smooth functions?
  We give near-matching upper- and lower-bounds for L2-approximation in terms of the
  Lipschitz constant, the desired accuracy, and the dimension of the problem, as well
  as similar results in terms of Sobolev norms. Our positive results employ tools
  from harmonic analysis and ridgelet representation theory, while our lower-bounds
  are based on (robust versions of) dimensionality arguments.'
