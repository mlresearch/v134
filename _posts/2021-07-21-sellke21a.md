title: 'Cooperative and Stochastic Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit: Optimal Regret
  With Neither Communication Nor Collisions'
abstract: We consider the cooperative multi-player version of the stochastic multi-armed
  bandit problem. We study the regime where the players cannot communicate but have
  access to shared randomness. In prior work by the first two authors, a strategy
  for this regime was constructed for two players and three arms, with regret $\tilde{O(\sqrt{T})}$,
  and with no collisions at all between the players (with very high probability).
  In this paper we show that these properties (near-optimal regret and no collisions
  at all) are achievable for any number of players and arms. At a high level, the
  previous strategy heavily relied on a 2-dimensional geometric intuition that was
  difficult to generalize in higher dimensions, while here we take a more combinatorial
  route to build the new strategy.
