title: "The Bethe and Sinkhorn Permanents of Low Rank\r Matrices and Implications
  for Profile Maximum\r Likelihood"
abstract: "In this paper we consider the problem of computing\r the likelihood of
  the profile of a discrete\r distribution, i.e., the probability of observing the\r
  multiset of element frequencies, and computing a\r profile maximum likelihood (PML)
  distribution, i.e.,\r a distribution with the maximum profile\r likelihood. For
  each problem we provide polynomial\r time algorithms that given $n$ i.i.d. samples
  from\r a discrete distribution, achieve an approximation\r factor of $\\exp\\left(-O(\\sqrt{n}
  \\log n) \\right)$,\r improving upon the previous best-known bound\r achievable
  in polynomial time of $\\exp(-O(n^{2/3}\r \\log n))$ (Charikar, Shiragur and Sidford,\r
  2019). Through the work of Acharya, Das, Orlitsky\r and Suresh (2016), this implies
  a polynomial time\r universal estimator for symmetric properties of\r discrete distributions
  in a broader range of error\r parameter.  To obtain our results on PML we\r establish
  new connections between PML and the\r well-studied Bethe and Sinkhorn approximations
  to\r the permanent (Vontobel, 2012 and 2014). It is known\r that the PML objective
  is proportional to the\r permanent of a certain Vandermonde matrix (Vontobel,\r
  2012) with $\\sqrt{n}$ distinct columns, i.e. with\r non-negative rank at most $\\sqrt{n}$.
  This allows us\r to show that the convex approximation to computing\r PML distributions
  studied in (Charikar, Shiragur and\r Sidford, 2019) is governed, in part, by the
  quality\r of Sinkhorn approximations to the permanent. We show\r that both Bethe
  and Sinkhorn permanents are\r $\\exp(O(k \\log(N/k)))$ approximations to the\r permanent
  of $N \\times N$ matrices with non-negative\r rank at most $k$. This improves upon
  the previous\r known bounds of $\\exp(O(N))$ and combining these\r insights with
  careful rounding of the convex\r relaxation yields our results."
