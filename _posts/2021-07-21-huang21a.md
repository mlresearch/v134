title: "Streaming k-PCA: Efficient guarantees for Oja’s\r algorithm, beyond rank-one
  updates"
abstract: "We analyze Oja’s algorithm for streaming $k$-PCA,\r and prove that it achieves
  performance nearly\r matching that of an optimal offline algorithm. Given\r access
  to a sequence of i.i.d. $d \\times d$\r symmetric matrices, we show that Oja’s algorithm
  can\r obtain an accurate approximation to the subspace of\r the top $k$ eigenvectors
  of their expectation using\r a number of samples that scales polylogarithmically\r
  with $d$. Previously, such a result was only known\r in the case where the updates
  have rank one.  Our\r analysis is based on recently developed matrix\r concentration
  tools, which allow us to prove strong\r bounds on the tails of the random matrices
  which\r arise in the course of the algorithm’s execution."
