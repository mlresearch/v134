title: 'Streaming k-PCA: Efficient guarantees for Oja’s algorithm, beyond rank-one
  updates'
abstract: We analyze Oja’s algorithm for streaming $k$-PCA, and prove that it achieves
  performance nearly matching that of an optimal offline algorithm. Given access to
  a sequence of i.i.d. $d \times d$ symmetric matrices, we show that Oja’s algorithm
  can obtain an accurate approximation to the subspace of the top $k$ eigenvectors
  of their expectation using a number of samples that scales polylogarithmically with
  $d$. Previously, such a result was only known in the case where the updates have
  rank one.  Our analysis is based on recently developed matrix concentration tools,
  which allow us to prove strong bounds on the tails of the random matrices which
  arise in the course of the algorithm’s execution.
