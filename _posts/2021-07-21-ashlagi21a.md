title: "Functions with average smoothness: structure,\r algorithms, and learning"
abstract: "We initiate a program of average smoothness analysis\r for efficiently
  learning real-valued functions on\r metric spaces. Rather than using the Lipschitz\r
  constant as the regularizer, we define a local slope\r at each point and gauge the
  function complexity as\r the average of these values. Since the mean can be\r dramatically
  smaller than the maximum, this\r complexity measure can yield considerably sharper\r
  generalization bounds — assuming that these admit\r a refinement where the Lipschitz
  constant is\r replaced by our average of local slopes. In addition\r to the usual
  average, we also examine a “weak”\r average that is more forgiving and yields a
  much\r wider function class.  Our first major contribution\r is to obtain just such
  distribution-sensitive\r bounds. This required overcoming a number of\r technical
  challenges, perhaps the most formidable of\r which was bounding the {\\em empirical}
  covering\r numbers, which can be much worse-behaved than the\r ambient ones. Our
  combinatorial results are\r accompanied by efficient algorithms for smoothing\r
  the labels of the random sample, as well as\r guarantees that the extension from
  the sample to the\r whole space will continue to be, with high\r probability, smooth
  on average. Along the way we\r discover a surprisingly rich combinatorial and\r
  analytic structure in the function class we define."
