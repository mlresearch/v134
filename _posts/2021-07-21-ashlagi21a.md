title: 'Functions with average smoothness: structure, algorithms, and learning'
abstract: We initiate a program of average smoothness analysis for efficiently learning
  real-valued functions on metric spaces. Rather than using the Lipschitz constant
  as the regularizer, we define a local slope at each point and gauge the function
  complexity as the average of these values. Since the mean can be dramatically smaller
  than the maximum, this complexity measure can yield considerably sharper generalization
  bounds — assuming that these admit a refinement where the Lipschitz constant is
  replaced by our average of local slopes. In addition to the usual average, we also
  examine a “weak” average that is more forgiving and yields a much wider function
  class.  Our first major contribution is to obtain just such distribution-sensitive
  bounds. This required overcoming a number of technical challenges, perhaps the most
  formidable of which was bounding the {\em empirical} covering numbers, which can
  be much worse-behaved than the ambient ones. Our combinatorial results are accompanied
  by efficient algorithms for smoothing the labels of the random sample, as well as
  guarantees that the extension from the sample to the whole space will continue to
  be, with high probability, smooth on average. Along the way we discover a surprisingly
  rich combinatorial and analytic structure in the function class we define.
