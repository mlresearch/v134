title: The Optimality of Polynomial Regression for Agnostic Learning under Gaussian
  Marginals in the SQ Model
abstract: We study the problem of agnostic learning under the Gaussian distribution
  in the Statistical Query (SQ) model.  We develop a method for finding hard families
  of examples for a wide range of concept classes by using LP duality.  For Boolean-valued
  concept classes, we show that the $L^1$-polynomial regression algorithm is essentially
  best possible among SQ algorithms, and therefore that the SQ complexity of agnostic
  learning is closely related to the polynomial degree required to approximate any
  function from the concept class in $L^1$-norm. Using this characterization along
  with additional analytic tools, we obtain explicit optimal SQ lower bounds for agnostically
  learning linear threshold functions and the first non-trivial explicit SQ lower
  bounds for polynomial threshold functions and intersections of halfspaces. We also
  develop an analogous theory for agnostically learning real-valued functions, and
  as an application prove near-optimal SQ lower bounds for agnostically learning ReLUs
  and sigmoids.
