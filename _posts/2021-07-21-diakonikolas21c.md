title: "The Optimality of Polynomial Regression for Agnostic\r Learning under Gaussian
  Marginals in the SQ Model"
abstract: "We study the problem of agnostic learning under the\r Gaussian distribution
  in the Statistical Query (SQ)\r model.  We develop a method for finding hard\r families
  of examples for a wide range of concept\r classes by using LP duality.  For Boolean-valued\r
  concept classes, we show that the $L^1$-polynomial\r regression algorithm is essentially
  best possible\r among SQ algorithms, and therefore that the SQ\r complexity of agnostic
  learning is closely related\r to the polynomial degree required to approximate any\r
  function from the concept class in $L^1$-norm. Using\r this characterization along
  with additional analytic\r tools, we obtain explicit optimal SQ lower bounds\r for
  agnostically learning linear threshold functions\r and the first non-trivial explicit
  SQ lower bounds\r for polynomial threshold functions and intersections\r of halfspaces.
  We also develop an analogous theory\r for agnostically learning real-valued functions,
  and\r as an application prove near-optimal SQ lower bounds\r for agnostically learning
  ReLUs and sigmoids."
