title: Deterministic Finite-Memory Bias Estimation
abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of estimating a Bernoulli parameter
  using finite memory. Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ be a sequence of independent identically
  distributed Bernoulli random variables with expectation $\theta$, where $\theta
  \in [0,1]$. Consider a finite-memory deterministic machine with $S$ states, that
  updates its state $M_n \in \{1,2,\ldots,S\}$ at each time according to the rule
  $M_n = f(M_{n-1},X_n)$, where $f$ is a deterministic time-invariant function. Assume
  that the machine outputs an estimate at each time point according to some fixed
  mapping from the state space to the unit interval. The quality of the estimation
  procedure is measured by the asymptotic risk, which is the long-term average of
  the instantaneous quadratic risk. The main contribution of this paper is an upper
  bound on the smallest worst-case asymptotic risk any such machine can attain. This
  bound coincides with a lower bound derived by Leighton and Rivest, to imply that
  $\Theta(1/S)$ is the minimax asymptotic risk for deterministic $S$-state machines.
  In particular, our result disproves a longstanding $\Theta(\log S/S)$ conjecture
  for this quantity, also posed by Leighton and Rivest.
