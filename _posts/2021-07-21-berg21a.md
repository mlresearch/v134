title: Deterministic Finite-Memory Bias Estimation
abstract: "In this paper we consider the problem of estimating\r a Bernoulli parameter
  using finite memory. Let\r $X_1,X_2,\\ldots$ be a sequence of independent\r identically
  distributed Bernoulli random variables\r with expectation $\\theta$, where $\\theta
  \\in\r [0,1]$. Consider a finite-memory deterministic\r machine with $S$ states,
  that updates its state $M_n\r \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,S\\}$ at each time according to
  the\r rule $M_n = f(M_{n-1},X_n)$, where $f$ is a\r deterministic time-invariant
  function. Assume that\r the machine outputs an estimate at each time point\r according
  to some fixed mapping from the state space\r to the unit interval. The quality of
  the estimation\r procedure is measured by the asymptotic risk, which\r is the long-term
  average of the instantaneous\r quadratic risk. The main contribution of this paper\r
  is an upper bound on the smallest worst-case\r asymptotic risk any such machine
  can attain. This\r bound coincides with a lower bound derived by\r Leighton and
  Rivest, to imply that $\\Theta(1/S)$ is\r the minimax asymptotic risk for deterministic\r
  $S$-state machines. In particular, our result\r disproves a longstanding $\\Theta(\\log
  S/S)$\r conjecture for this quantity, also posed by Leighton\r and Rivest."
