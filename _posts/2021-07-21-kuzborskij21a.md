title: "Nonparametric Regression with Shallow\r Overparameterized Neural Networks
  Trained by GD with\r Early Stopping"
abstract: "We explore the ability of overparameterized shallow\r neural networks to
  learn Lipschitz regression\r functions with and without label noise when trained\r
  by Gradient Descent (GD). To avoid the problem that\r in the presence of noisy labels,
  neural networks\r trained to nearly zero training error are\r inconsistent on this
  class, we propose an early\r stopping rule that allows us to show optimal\r rates.
  This provides an alternative to the result of\r Hu et al. (2021) who studied the
  performance of\r $\\ell_2$-regularized GD for training shallow\r networks in nonparametric
  regression which fully\r relied on the infinite-width network (Neural Tangent\r
  Kernel (NTK)) approximation. Here we present a\r simpler analysis which is based
  on a partitioning\r argument of the input space (as in the case of\r 1-nearest-neighbor
  rule) coupled with the fact that\r trained neural networks are smooth with respect
  to\r their inputs when trained by GD. In the noise-free\r case the proof does not
  rely on any kernelization\r and can be regarded as a finite-width result. In the\r
  case of label noise, by slightly modifying the\r proof, the noise is controlled
  using a technique of\r Yao, Rosasco, and Caponnetto (2007)."
