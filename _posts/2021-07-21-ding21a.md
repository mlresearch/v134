title: Random Coordinate Langevin Monte Carlo
abstract: 'Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
  method. One drawback is that it requires the computation of the full gradient at
  each iteration, an expensive operation if the dimension of the problem is high.
  We propose a new sampling method: Random Coordinate LMC (RC-LMC). At each iteration,
  a single coordinate is randomly selected to be updated by a multiple of the partial
  derivative along this direction plus noise, while all other coordinates remain untouched.
  We investigate the total complexity of RC-LMC and compare it with the classical
  LMC for log-concave probability distributions. We show that when the gradient of
  the log-density is Lipschitz, RC-LMC is less expensive than the classical LMC if
  the log-density is highly skewed for high dimensional problems. Further, when both
  the gradient and the Hessian of the log-density are Lipschitz, RC-LMC is always
  cheaper than the classical LMC, by a factor proportional to the square root of the
  problem dimension. In the latter case, we use an example to demonstrate that our
  estimate of complexity is sharp with respect to the dimension.'
