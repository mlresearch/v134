title: Random Coordinate Langevin Monte Carlo
abstract: "Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is a popular Markov chain\r Monte Carlo sampling
  method. One drawback is that it\r requires the computation of the full gradient
  at\r each iteration, an expensive operation if the\r dimension of the problem is
  high. We propose a new\r sampling method: Random Coordinate LMC (RC-LMC). At\r each
  iteration, a single coordinate is randomly\r selected to be updated by a multiple
  of the partial\r derivative along this direction plus noise, while\r all other coordinates
  remain untouched. We\r investigate the total complexity of RC-LMC and\r compare
  it with the classical LMC for log-concave\r probability distributions. We show that
  when the\r gradient of the log-density is Lipschitz, RC-LMC is\r less expensive
  than the classical LMC if the\r log-density is highly skewed for high dimensional\r
  problems. Further, when both the gradient and the\r Hessian of the log-density are
  Lipschitz, RC-LMC is\r always cheaper than the classical LMC, by a factor\r proportional
  to the square root of the problem\r dimension. In the latter case, we use an example
  to\r demonstrate that our estimate of complexity is sharp\r with respect to the
  dimension."
