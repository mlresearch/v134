title: 'PAC-Bayes, MAC-Bayes and Conditional Mutual Information: Fast rate bounds
  that handle general VC classes'
abstract: We give a novel, unified derivation of conditional PAC-Bayesian and mutual
  information (MI) generalization bounds. We derive conditional MI bounds as an instance,
  with special choice of prior, of conditional MAC-Bayesian (Mean Approximately Correct)
  bounds, itself derived from conditional PAC-Bayesian bounds, where ‘conditional’
  means that one can use priors conditioned on a joint training and ghost sample.  This
  allows us to get nontrivial PAC-Bayes and MI-style bounds for general VC classes,
  something recently shown to be impossible with standard PAC-Bayesian/MI bounds.
  Second, it allows us to get fast rates of order $O((\text{KL}/n)^{\gamma}$ for $\gamma
  > 1/2$ if a Bernstein condition holds and for exp-concave losses (with $\gamma=1$),
  which is impossible with both standard PAC-Bayes generalization and MI bounds. Our
  work extends the recent work by Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020) who handle MI with
  VC but neither PAC-Bayes nor fast rates and Mhammedi et al. (2019) who initiated
  fast rate PAC-Bayes generalization error bounds but handle neither MI nor general
  VC classes.
