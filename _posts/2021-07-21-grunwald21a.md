title: "PAC-Bayes, MAC-Bayes and Conditional Mutual\r Information: Fast rate bounds
  that handle general VC\r classes"
abstract: "We give a novel, unified derivation of conditional\r PAC-Bayesian and mutual
  information (MI)\r generalization bounds. We derive conditional MI\r bounds as an
  instance, with special choice of prior,\r of conditional MAC-Bayesian (Mean Approximately\r
  Correct) bounds, itself derived from conditional\r PAC-Bayesian bounds, where ‘conditional’
  means that\r one can use priors conditioned on a joint training\r and ghost sample.
  \ This allows us to get nontrivial\r PAC-Bayes and MI-style bounds for general VC\r
  classes, something recently shown to be impossible\r with standard PAC-Bayesian/MI
  bounds. Second, it\r allows us to get fast rates of order\r $O((\\text{KL}/n)^{\\gamma}$
  for $\\gamma > 1/2$ if a\r Bernstein condition holds and for exp-concave losses\r
  (with $\\gamma=1$), which is impossible with both\r standard PAC-Bayes generalization
  and MI bounds. Our\r work extends the recent work by Steinke and\r Zakynthinou (2020)
  who handle MI with VC but neither\r PAC-Bayes nor fast rates and Mhammedi et al.
  (2019)\r who initiated fast rate PAC-Bayes generalization\r error bounds but handle
  neither MI nor general VC\r classes."
